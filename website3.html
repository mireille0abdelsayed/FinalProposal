2120Calibre 2120 is one of the most famous in the watch industry. Its long history is told in a dedicated article available here. Jointly developed by LeCoutre &amp; Cie, Audemars Piguet and Vacheron Constantin, it remained for several decades the world's thinnest mechanical movement with automatic winding and central rotor. It is notably distinguished by its 21-carat oscillating weight on ruby rollers, which gravitates around a circular track. For a long time, movement blank production was carried out by LeCoultre &amp; Cie (renamed Jaeger-LeCoultre in 1979), before being brought in-house in the Audemars Piguet workshops at the beginning of the 21st century. Model 5271 was the first to be equipped with Calibre 2120, followed by dozens of others, including several Royal Oak limited series from 1992 (14789, 14793, 14811, etc.). While the exact number of 2120 movements produced by Audemars Piguet remains to be seen, statistics from 1967 to 1995 show that more than 12,000 were cased during this period alone. Its derivative Calibre 2121 was even more successful and equipped the Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; until the end of 2021.

As we shall see, this is not merely a matter of terminology. At Audemars Piguet, the term Manufacture has been used in advertising since the 19th century. A guarantee of fine craftsmanship, the word manufacture means “hand-made”. The expression is derived from the Latin for manum meaning “hand” and factum signifying “made”. However, from the 1990s onwards and particularly under the influence of watch marketing, the meaning of the term shifted to imply that the complete watch is produced entirely under the roof of a given brand. As a result, the expression &quot;Manufacture made&quot; came to be regarded as a guarantee of integrity and value, becoming the ultimate goal, the Holy Grail. This vision emerged from the Swiss watch industry’s period of renewal following the quartz crisis (approximately between 1975 and 1985), during which the major watchmaking groups (Swatch Group, Richemont, LVMH...) bought up numerous suppliers, sometimes reserving their expertise and production for themselves. Audemars Piguet took part in this transformation and achieved the status of integrated Manufacture within this context. Vertical integration was the only means of maintaining the independence of the family business. In 1999 it led to the creation of the first in-house movement, Calibre 3090, followed by the selfwinding Calibre 3120 in 2003 and many others. This process was also accompanied by the production of cases at its dedicated Manufacture in Meyrin (Centror) and subsequently by that of dials in Le Brassus. This new reality should not obscure the fact that, for more than a century, Audemars Piguet was an integral part of the établissage system. Within this production mode, the établisseur assembled and finished watch mechanisms whose components were produced in a large number of highly specialised workshops, from small home-based dial-makers to large movement-blank factories. Nurtured by friendships and combining talents as well as ideas, this dense and dynamic network enabled the Swiss watch industry to flourish from the 19th century onwards. It was this ecosystem that gave rise to Calibre 2120. Ever since the 19th century, Audemars Piguet had been an établisseur. In the small Le Brassus workshops, a handful of watchmakers adjusted, finished, assembled and fitted components made by independent Vallée de Joux artisans such as Louis Elisée Piguet, Louis Audemars, Victorin Piguet, Alfred Aubert and many others. Relationships between these craftsmen often went well beyond the strict setting of the workbench and extended to the choir and the gymnastics or ski jumping club. In a remote valley, everyone knew each other, friendships consolidated solid work collaborations and family relationships deepened them. By way of example, Georges Golay – who joined Audemars Piguet in 1945 and would later run the company from 1967 to 1987 – was a great friend and card-playing companion of former managing director Roger LeCoultre (1906 – 1971). This friendship is just one expression of the strong ties that Audemars Piguet and LeCoultre &amp; Cie (renamed Jaeger-LeCoultre in 1979) nurtured from the 19th century onwards. Mentions of these relations appear in the archives since at least 1882, but it was in the aftermath of World War II, and more specifically from 1948 onwards, that these companies drew closer together. A third player played an important role in the birth and development of Calibre 2120. In the 1960s, Geneva-based company Vacheron Constantin already had an over two-century history behind it. It belonged to the same financial entity as LeCoultre &amp; Cie: the SAPIC group (Société Anonyme des Participations Industrielles et Commerciales). In addition to this close relationship with the movement blank manufacturer, Vacheron Constantin had been a loyal customer of Audemars Piguet since the 1880s. In the 1950s, the ties were so strong that some Audemars Piguet watches were sold in the Vacheron Constantin boutique in Geneva! It was in fact Vacheron Constantin’s Sales Manager, Francis Berger, who sold the first white gold Royal Oak to the Shah of Iran in 1972, a unique piece crafted upon his request. Let us now take a look at Calibre 2120, which measures a mere 2.45 mm in thickness. Drastically reducing the thickness of a mechanism represented a major technical feat. At Audemars Piguet, this speciality appeared between 1900 and 1910, at a time when competition was particularly intense in the field of miniaturisation. In 1921, for example, Audemars Piguet’s 1.32 mm-thick Calibre 17SVF#5 (Ch. Piguet movement blank), beat the record set by its neighbour LeCoultre &amp; Cie in 1907. It measured 0.06 mm less (the equivalent of a hair’s breadth!) In the wake of World War II, Audemars Piguet specialised in ultra-thin watches. This previously secondary field of interest became a core activity. In 1958, over 75% of Audemars Piguet watches contained Calibre 2003, a barely 1.64 mm-thick mechanism whose design was developed by LeCoultre &amp; Cie. Another prominent feature of post-war watchmaking was the spread of selfwinding movements. This system involves an oscillating weight (or rotor) that rotates each time the wearer moves their wrist, in such a way as to use this energy to drive the mechanism. The post-war boom period was dominated by new values and lifestyles: speed, efficiency, modernity, travel, multiple activities and youth. The spirit of the times was perfectly in tune with the rise of the selfwinding watch. What active man still had time to hand-wind his watch? Watchmakers were firm believers in this innovation, even though it would take time to convince some of the more conservative markets, particularly because the first selfwinding movements were very thick. In 1954, Audemars Piguet introduced its first selfwinding watches, notably Model 5112. Calibres 2498 and 2499 (LeCoultre movement blank 498-499, 6.65 mm thick) were wound by a gold oscillating weight featuring a Clous de Paris guilloché pattern. They were soon complemented and subsequently replaced by Calibres 2070, 2071 and 2072. Until that point, however, none of the selfwinding movements were thin, nor vice versa. Everyone was aware that a brand offering these two qualities in the same watch would have a significant edge, as confirmed by a letter dated 1958. LeCoultre had just suggested adding a date to Calibre 2498. Audemars Piguet refused because it would increase the thickness of the movement, arguing that “the clientele comes to us mainly for slim watches.” The message specified: “As competition is becoming ever stronger, we must be careful regarding the thickness of our products.” In fact, as early as 1960, Piaget introduced Calibre 12P which was just 2.3 mm thick, notably thanks to a micro-rotor serving to fit the oscillating weight into the thickness of the mechanism. Audemars Piguet chose a central rotor, a more powerful device yet a far more difficult option. At the time, Jacques-Louis Audemars, grandson of one of the brand's founders, was in charge of developing new watch mechanisms. Technical Director and future Chair of the Board of Directors, he was above all a watchmaker. The Audemars Piguet company records contain a mention of a project for an ultra-thin selfwinding movement undertaken with Frédéric Piguet in 1960 but which never came to fruition. They do not specify whether LeCoultre, Vacheron Constantin or Audemars Piguet first launched the idea of Calibre 2120, but they suggest that it was the Manufacture in Le Brassus that took the lead. On June 9, 1964, Jacques-Louis Audemars complained to LeCoultre: “For the past three or four years we have been keeping our customers waiting and they are finding it increasingly hard to understand why the specialists in ultra-thin, high-luxury watches are still offering selfwinding watches that are among the thickest on the market!” In another letter, Jean Lebet, Technical Director of LeCoultre, recalled the history of the project. He explained that in 1962, a watchmaker by the name of Mainjot had presented a “patented selfwinding device which, according to him, should make it possible to produce a 2.3 mm-thick movement on the basis of the 803 movement blank (Calibre 2003).” The project was aborted because this mechanism required lengthy adjustments by the most highly skilled watchmakers and only the aforementioned Mainjot was capable of handling this task. LeCoultre then entrusted the project to Fernand Reymond, an experienced movement design engineer, but who died prematurely. The Audemars Piguet archives contain correspondence with LeCoultre &amp; Cie concerning the development of Calibre 2120. Letters, internal notes, sketches and prototype test reports attest to intense collaboration. Jacques-Louis Audemars regularly visited the village of Le Sentier, four kilometres from Le Brassus. There, he met with movement design engineer Maurice Audemars to discuss issues such as winding, springs, power reserve, thickness, balance wheel, barrel, etc. Maurice Audemars (ca. 1923–1974), a watchmaker-engineer who trained at the Vallée de Joux Technical School, was one of the industry’s hidden figures. Although the sources say little about him, he nevertheless played a fundamental role in the history of watchmaking. He invented several selfwinding systems (notably including patents CH256020A in 1948 and CH343294 in 1959). It is his name that appears on the selfwinding patent for Calibre 2120 filed on October 18, 1965 under number CH14388\u002F65. Some sources, including the founder of AP Customer Service, Wilfred Berney, credit him with the paternity of the legendary Calibre 2003 (LeCoultre 803 movement blank) which he apparently created in 1953 at the age of 30. This 1.64 mm-thick mechanism was to make its mark on the entire second half of the 20th century. It was therefore natural that Calibre 2003 should serve as the basis for the development of Calibre 2120, with which it shares several components. Plans from 1961 showing the reference 920 (the LeCoultre name for Calibre 2120) suggest that the project was already underway and really kicked off in the spring of 1963. The movement’s characteristics were steadily adjusted in terms of thickness, frequency and power reserve. From June 1964 to April 1965, Jacques-Louis Audemars wore a prototype on his wrist. Most of the plans were drawn up in 1966 and the first models were delivered in 1967 – the same year the very first quartz movements for wristwatches were introduced in the industry. Calibre 2120 was endowed with outstanding characteristics. In 1967, its overall thickness of just 2.45 mm earned it the title of the world's thinnest selfwinding calibre with a central rotor, a status it would retain for decades. The text of patent CH14338\u002F65 explains its main innovative feature. Its winding system delivered performance superior to that of the micro-rotor because the diameter of the rotor was wide (28 mm) and its weight was heavy: &quot;the winding weight or rotor of a selfwinding watch must be as heavy as possible and notably feature the largest possible gyration radius. But in an ultra-thin mechanism, these qualities (diameter and thickness) might have weakened the system, especially in the event of impacts. Calibre 2120 nonetheless provided a simple solution: the rotor was supported on the periphery by ruby rollers, turning somewhat like train wheels on a railway track, “in order to reduce the strong tensions on the central axis bearing the rotor and keep the efforts involved in central pivoting to a minimum.” The circular rail is one of the most recognisable visual elements of this calibre. To ensure enhanced thinness, the movement does not feature a seconds hand. Its frequency corresponds to 19,800 vibrations per hour. It is equipped with an anti-shock system produced by the Kif Parechocs company, also based in the Vallée de Joux. The winding is bidirectional, which means that the mechanism is wound regardless of the rotor’s rotation direction. The decoration respects the highest standards, as indicated in finishing table 41131: circular graining, satin-brushing, polished sinks, chamfering, polishing, “Côtes de Genève”, gilding, snailing, felt polishing, etc. It is worth noting that the 21-carat gold oscillating weight is finely engraved with the inscription &quot;Audemars-Piguet&quot; (the hyphen between the two names is a curiosity of this calibre). On March 22, 1967, four years after the real start of the project, Audemars Piguet delivered the first ten watches equipped with Calibre 2120, which was first fitted into Model 5271, designed by Gérald Genta. Subsequently, the round Models 5272, 5273, 5274 and more creative variants (5279, 5285, 5287, 5302, 5307, 5384) were produced. In 1967, more than 650 Audemars Piguet watches were already equipped with Calibre 2120! In ten years, more than 12,000 were sold. Within a few years, the movement replaced the 2070-71-72 versions, becoming one of the spearheads of the Manufacture. It also served in 1970 as the basis for the creation of the 2121 version with a date indication. Slightly thicker (3.05 mm), the latter notably equipped the first Royal Oak in 1972 and served as the basis for the 2800 perpetual calendar under-dial work introduced in 1978, which revitalised the history of complicated watches. The watch industry microcosm thrives on rumours. A long-running one holds that LeCoultre Calibre 920 (921 with date) had been developed by Jaeger-LeCoultre for three companies: Audemars Piguet (Refs. 2120 and 2121); Vacheron Constantin (Refs. 1120 and 1121) and Patek Philippe (Refs. 28.255 and 28.255c – numbers referring to the 28 mm diameter and a 2.55 mm thickness without the date, meaning 0.1 mm more than the 2120 version). Yet to this day, there are no documents revealing the terms of a possible contract between the four companies. If the Audemars Piguet archives have not kept a copy, that might be because it was an exclusively verbal agreement. On the other hand, it is well known that Audemars Piguet used this mechanism to power its first Royal Oak in 1972, Patek Philippe its first Nautilus as early as 1976 and that Vacheron Constantin equipped its 222 Overseas model with it as early as 1977. Specialists also agree that Jaeger-LeCoultre never fitted this movement – nor Calibre 2003 – in its own watches. Studying the Audemars Piguet archives has revealed that Vacheron Constantin was involved in the development of the mechanism between 1963 and 1966. Patek Philippe, on the other hand, seems to be entirely absent from these discussions. While this might lead one to believe that the Geneva firm played no role in the development, careful examination of the sources adds nuance to any such assertion. The Patek Philippe reference number &quot;25.855&quot; appeared on LeCoultre’s plans as early as February 28, 1965 and was regularly mentioned thereafter. However tenuous, these mentions nevertheless support the hypothesis that the development of the movement was funded by the watchmaking trio of the time, which retained exclusive use of it. It is now an indisputable fact that Audemars Piguet, in the person of Jacques-Louis Audemars, played the most active role in the technical collaboration with LeCoultre &amp; Cie. Calibre 2120 and its derivative Calibre 2121 have continued to evolve since 1967. The first years required numerous adjustments. The balance staff, for example, was redesigned six times in the period up to 1971! These multiple redesigns can be explained by the difficulty of creating an extremely thin regulating organ that was still large enough to ensure perfect reliability. At the heart of the regulating organ is the balance. This component performs a to-and-fro motion around a central axis that determines the tick-tock cadence of the watch. Its regularity is essential to ensuring accuracy. In 1967, Calibre 2120 was equipped with a &quot;variable inertia&quot; balance fitted on its periphery with small inertia-blocks (off-centred weights). The adjuster turns these weights manually to modify the speed of the balance and compensate for the gain or loss of the watch, somewhat like a figure skater who accelerates when spinning by tucking her arms closer to her body. The experienced eye will moreover note the blue balance spring. Between 1978 and 1980, the regulating organ evolved towards a simpler system. From then on, a three-armed annular balance was adjusted by means of an index (also known as a regulator) serving to modify the tension of the balance spring and the speed of oscillation. At the same time, Audemars Piguet simplified the aesthetics of the balance bridge. The mechanism was renamed Calibre 2120\u002F1. While this major transformation streamlined production, it made the watchmakers’ work much trickier, to the point where – faced with recurring adjustment problems – Audemars Piguet reintroduced the variable-inertia balance in 1991. The mechanism was renamed Calibre 2120\u002F3. Further improvements were made. For the attention of watchmakers, we should for example mention that in 2012 the angle of lift was reduced by three degrees and the pallet-lever bridge detent-pins were rectified. The following year, the barrel pivot was jewelled to eliminate wear caused by friction... During the early years of its history, Calibre 2120 and its derivatives remained hidden, well protected inside watch cases. Only watchmakers could admire them when performing services or repairs. The arrival of quartz overturned such codes and the mechanical content of a watch could no longer be taken for granted. It was time to highlight traditional expertise and reveal the beating heart of the watch. To do so, Audemars Piguet decided to reintroduce an art in which the brand had excelled in the 1930s and 50s, but which had all but vanished from the workshops: openworking, also referred to as skeletonisation. This art consists of using a tiny hacksaw to remove as much material as possible from the movement bridges so as to reveal its mysteries without impairing its functions, before decorating each component by hand. Openworking is time-consuming and requires considerable manual dexterity. It was introduced during the depression of the 1930s, in order to keep watchmakers busy following the steep drop in orders. In 1972, the situation was different. First and foremost, it was a matter of highlighting the beauty of mechanical movements faced with the advent of quartz. Audemars Piguet decided to create a workshop dedicated to this art and relied on the experience of its veterans to train the new generation of artisans. Of the 86 employees, nine watchmakers had been working for the Manufacture for at least 20 years. Two of them were already at the bench in 1930, including Paul Edward Piguet, son of the company’s co-founder. It was during the winter of 1972 – 1973 that a few young watchmakers set about rediscovering openworking, undoubtedly aided and abetted by their elders. Georges Golay’s vision was ambitious, as the operation kicked off with a hundred examples of Calibre 2120. The first watch was delivered on November 31, 1973. A masterpiece of meticulous craftsmanship and fine detail, Model 5442 provided a complex stage-setting for its mechanism. Through the caseback, the openworked oscillating weight revealed the AP monogram, in a pattern that would inspire the weights of Calibres 2120, 2121 and 2120\u002F2800 for decades. Five more timepieces were delivered in December and an average of 30 watches were produced annually until 1976. In the 1970s, it took a trained craftsman 150 hours to openwork a Calibre 2120. The workshop therefore had to expand. It took three years to complete the first 100 watches. While the same period of time was required for the next hundred, Audemars Piguet had in parallel decided to openwork Calibre 2003, which was even smaller than the 2120. In 1978, 300 openworked watches fitted with Calibre 2120 were produced. In 1984, the workshop already had a dozen artisans entirely dedicated to the art of openworking. Openworking was introduced into the Royal Oak collection in 1986, through Model 25636 equipped with a perpetual calendar. A pendant pocket watch version followed in the 1980s, Model 25729. In 1992, Models 14815, 14816 and 14929 introduced their openworked Calibre 2003. From then on, while evolving stylistically, the openworking speciality became an integral part of the Royal Oak collection, which included more than 40 models created between 1992 and 2022, four of which were fitted with Calibre 2120: Models 14814, 15052, 15053 and 15136. Although it enhances the beauty of watch mechanisms, openworking can only be applied to small series, as it requires a considerable amount of time: nearly one month for a single movement. As an interesting alternative, a sapphire caseback reveals only the reverse side of the movement, which watchmakers call the “bridge side”, as opposed to the “dial side”. While a sapphire caseback does not require openworking the movement, hand-engraved bridges or special oscillating weights often accompanied its earliest occurrences. Before the 1990s, there were very few non-openworked watches with sapphire casebacks. The Heritage Collection has only one example, Model 5283. The story really begins in 1992, when the Royal Oak celebrated its 20th anniversary. To mark the occasion, Stephen Urquhart and Georges-Henri Meylan, who had been joint managing directors of the company since the death of Georges Golay in 1987, decided to revive the legendary Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; equipped with Calibre 2121. Model 14802 staged its rotor behind a sapphire crystal. The oscillating weight was specially designed for the jubilee and bore the engraving of the small Royal Oak number (see the article on numbering). Issued in a 1,000-piece limited edition, it was so successful that in 1996, the Royal Oak “Jumbo” returned to the current collection, Model 15002, this time with a solid caseback. In 2000, the world celebrated a new millennium and Audemars Piguet its 125th anniversary. At the same time, the brand-new Royal Oak “Jumbo” 15202 with its white “Grande Tapisserie” dial definitively adopted the sapphire caseback. The oscillating weight with its arabesque motif was inspired by the first openworked Calibre 2120 introduced in 1973 (see above). Informed connoisseurs will have noted that, as early as 1986, Royal Oak perpetual calendar watches equipped with Calibre 2120\u002F2800 had already adopted this highly decorative rotor, in particular on Models 25636 and 25686. The third key milestone in this evolution appeared at the best possible time, coinciding with the Royal Oak’s 40th anniversary. In 2012, an exhibition celebrating both contemporary art and the history of the Royal Oak travelled to New York and Milan before bringing together in Geneva the 1,000 employees then working on the brand's development. The aesthetics of the 15202's rotor were modernised, with arabesques giving way to angles and facets, accentuated by a double-row “Clous de Paris” pattern. The oscillating weight echoed the watch’s artistic expression and this aesthetic was preserved in Calibre 5134 which replaced Calibre 2120\u002F2800 in 2015 and in the openworked Calibre 5122 released in 2014. The history of Calibre 2120 and its derivative 2121 almost petered out at the end of the 1990s. During that decade, this mechanical masterpiece was almost exclusively used in the rare Royal Oak “Jumbo” watches still made by Audemars Piguet, in particular Models 14802 (1992) and 15002 (1996) as well as the 2120\u002F2801-2 perpetual calendar versions. However, sales slowly declined due to the ascending popularity of Royal Oak Offshore and complication timepieces. As a result, the stock of unfinished blanks swelled to almost 400 units by 1999 and year after year, the flow of orders to Jaeger-LeCoultre gradually dwindled to a mere trickle. Wilfred Berney, founder of Audemars Piguet’s Customer Service Department in 1976, wrote a memoir about Calibre 2120\u002F2800 just before he retired in 2007. The document states that: “In 1999, Jaeger-LeCoultre informed AP of its decision to cease the production of blanks for this movement.” This change was part of the reshaping of the Swiss watch industry, which notably saw the integration of Jaeger-LeCoultre into the Richemont group. At Audemars Piguet, the vertical integration of production was already a core concern. It led to Calibre 3090 in 1999, by which time the fourth generation of the founding families had taken its place on the Board of Directors. Jasmine Audemars and Olivier Audemars wished to accelerate the process. The integration of Calibre 2120 almost represented a welcome opportunity, or at least a priority. Wilfred Berney writes that “despite major difficulties”, the project was completed in 2002. This statement is supported by the large number of plans for the Calibres 2120 and 2121 drawn up by the Audemars Piguet Technical Department as early as 2000. Bruno Moutarlier, who served as Industrial Director for Audemars Piguet between 2004 and 2006, testified in an October 2020 interview that Jaeger-LeCoultre had simultaneously given up producing the 2003 Calibre: “There were discussions with Vacheron Constantin.” The two companies are thought to have divided the calibres between them, with the Geneva-based firm taking over the production of the ultra-thin hand-wound movement designed in 1953 and Audemars Piguet handling Calibre 2120 and its derivatives, while supplying components to Patek Philippe’s customer service. In this way, the former établisseurs became the manufacturers. In 2022, after 55 years of loyal service, Calibre 2120 and its derivative Calibre 2121 gave way to a new generation. Benefiting from the latest technical advances and developed by Audemars Piguet engineers and watchmakers, Calibre 7121 heralds a new chapter in the history of ultra-thin selfwinding mechanisms.

This additional function raised its thickness to 3.05 mm, making it the world's thinnest mechanical selfwinding movement with a central rotor and date. The history of Calibres 2120 and 2121 will be told in detail in a dedicated article available soon. Calibre 2121 was introduced in October 1970 in Model 5381. It was fitted in numerous ultra-thin selfwinding watches before being chosen in 1972 for the first Royal Oak, Model 5402. From that date onwards and until its replacement in 2022 by the 7121 (Model 16202), Calibre 2121 was one of the essential attributes of the Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; watches. For a long time, Calibre 2121 blanks were produced in Le Sentier by LeCoultre &amp; Cie (renamed Jaeger-LeCoultre in 1979). From the start of the 21st century, it was produced by the Audemars Piguet workshops in Le Brassus. During its first quarter-century of existence, nearly 20,000 Calibre 2121 watches were produced and used in numerous references across several collections. Since the dawn of the 21st century, with a few exceptions, the calibre has been reserved for the Royal Oak “Jumbo”. Production between 2000 and 2021 exceeded 12,000 units. In 2012, an openworked 2121SQ variation was created for a model celebrating the 40th anniversary of this ultra-thin collection. In 2022, the movement was replaced by Calibre 7121.

A few months before his death, at the age of 80, Gérald Genta (1931–2011) granted a long recorded interview to Audemars Piguet that provided the backbone for the beginning of the story we are exploring here. Admittedly, in 41 years, recollections can become somewhat hazy and certain dates or facts do not stand up to cross-referencing, while others are somewhat romanticised. Nevertheless, the heart of the story remains intact, because strong emotions make for engraved memories. In 1970, the designer already had a premonition of creating the masterpiece of his career. At that time, Audemars Piguet had just experienced the strongest 20 years of growth in its almost century-long history as it benefitted from the post-war economic boom. In two decades, it had gone from 35 to 84 employees – of whom 67 were active at the workbench – and had increased its production tenfold to 5,500 watches per year. Its turnover had followed the same progression and was nearing 10 million Swiss francs. Audemars Piguet was by then in the hands of the founding families’ second and third generations, represented by Paul Edward Piguet (1890–1979) and Jacques-Louis Audemars (1910–2002), and had been run by Georges Golay (1921–1987) for the previous three years. The latter was a visionary entrepreneur, the son of a farmer and a native of the Vallée de Joux, who had participated in modernising the brand since his arrival in 1945. After World War II, Audemars Piguet established a close working relationship with LeCoultre &amp; Cie, which supplied the majority of its ébauches (unfinished movements), including Calibres 2120 and 2003, the world's thinnest in their categories. While complication watches remained an Audemars Piguet speciality, ultra-thin watches, often made with women in mind, accounted for over half of the production. Even though the notion of &quot;watch models&quot; was introduced in 1951, they were produced in very small series rarely exceeding 10 identical timepieces that were often one-of-a-kind. The increase in production required a rethink of distribution, a tricky issue for a company like Audemars Piguet that was still modestly sized at the time and whose location in a small mountain village was not conducive to reaching an international clientele. To resolve this delicate equation, Georges Golay decided to think big. He had just signed a partnership with Swiss watchmaking giant, the Société Suisse pour l'Industrie Horlogère SSIH (not to be confused with the SIHH, the watch fair founded in Geneva in 1991). As the leading Swiss watch manufacturer and third in the world with 4.6 million watches in 1970, the SSIH employed nearly 7,000 people and controlled 20 brands, whose watches it distributed through 160 agents and 15,000 retailers. In the late 1960s, the SSIH was looking to expand its range by offering very high-end watches in addition to its flagship Omega timepieces. Audemars Piguet, on the other hand, needed to expand its distribution network. The agreement between AP and the SSIH was signed on February 5, 1969, after a year of negotiations. Audemars Piguet retained its complete independence in terms of both capital and manufacturing, but the brand from Le Brassus could now use SSIH general agents to distribute its watches. What Audemars Piguet had not foreseen was the proposal subsequently put forward by some of these agents, who included strong personalities, in particular Carlo de Marchi (Italomega, Turin, Italy), Charles Bauty (Gameo, Lausanne, Switzerland) and Charles Dorot (Brandt Frères, Paris, France). According to Martin K. Wehrli, who joined Audemars Piguet in 1971 and served as sales manager and then Director of the Museum until 2012, these three agents were long nicknamed “the three musketeers”. More on that later. The birth of the Royal Oak is closely linked to the Basel Fair, held annually in April, which at the time was the watch industry meeting place. Brands, agents and distributors from around the world converged there for ten days to discover new products, share their opinions, talk about the future, explore new horizons and cultivate friendships over cigars and good wine. Above all, distributors placed orders for the coming year, thus enabling manufacturers to establish or fine-tune their production plans. In 1970, the fair officially opened on April 11, but many distributors arrived in the city before the opening. Some of them took advantage of the opportunity to make a side-trip to Milan, the international capital of fashion, to take in the latest trends. On April 10, 1970, Georges Golay met his new SSIH agents Carlo de Marchi, Charles Bauty and Charles Dorot. Verbal sources agree that it was then that the “three musketeers” challenged the Managing Director of Audemars Piguet to create what would become the Royal Oak. We do not know the exact content of the dialogue, but in an interview from February 1982, Georges Golay explained: “The Royal Oak was conceived in 1970, at the suggestion of general agents who had reservations about the marketing value of gold alone for the promotion of high-prestige timepieces – a view which I believe is no longer valid. They did ask us to design a stainless steel wristwatch more in tune with the way we live today. We had to invent a model both sporty and stylish in spirit, suitable for evening wear and for the daily activities of today’s man of taste.” What the Managing Director might have added was that the powerful agents also needed a watch that was produced in sufficient quantities to supply their most prestigious outlets. Georges Golay has every reason to sidestep the issue. He could have argued that Audemars Piguet was doing better than ever, that the collections were increasingly successful and that the refinement of the often out-of-the-ordinary design and the perfection of the finishes was incompatible with large-scale production. He might well have added that the quality of these finishes was unsuitable for the impacts and friction involved in sporting activities and that they would almost be impossible to achieve on a steel case (why would one sip a great vintage from a plastic cup?!). He could also have pointed out that these decorations would simply not make sense because their cost would dramatically increase the watch’s price. It would be commercially suicidal to sell a steel watch at the price of a gold watch, especially as the market for steel sports watches was already saturated with successful models such as the Omega Seamaster, the Tag Heuer Monaco, the Jaeger-LeCoultre Polaris and the Rolex Oyster. Finally, Georges Golay might have argued that if, by some miracle, a steel AP sports model were to be successful, Audemars Piguet’s identity could risk being distorted. Nonetheless, against all odds, Georges Golay followed his instincts. A man with considerable experience in the field and an outstanding salesman, he knew that the world was in the midst of a socio-cultural and financial upheaval: the United States had just suspended the dollar convertibility to gold. The Swiss watchmaking world was emerging from the state cartel-based regime and was wondering how to react to the arrival of a promising new technology that was foreign to the industry. Some people saw the quartz watch as the future of luxury watchmaking and others as the death knell of mechanical watchmaking. The cards were being reshuffled and many people rightly sensed that a major earthquake was imminent. Within such a context, it was worth taking a gamble. Georges Golay was a clever strategist who found himself in a position to reduce the financial risk by convincing his powerful distributors to buy the watches even before they were produced. More importantly, he had a secret asset: his collaboration with independent designer Gérald Genta ensured the presence of a talented partner capable of achieving the apparently impossible. In April 1970, Italian-born designer Gérald Genta was 38 years old. This trained jeweller had a strong personality and was no stranger to the watchmaking world, but he had not yet achieved the fame that would later earn him the “Picasso of Watches” nickname. He had not yet designed Patek Phillipe’s Nautilus (1976), revisited IWC’s Ingenieur (1976) or created the Bulgari Bulgari (1977). He had however sold hundreds of watch designs to numerous brands since the 1950s, including designing Universal’s Pole Router (1954) and revisiting Omega’s Constellation (1959). But before becoming more closely acquainted with Gérald Genta and his pioneering role, it is worth recalling the context in which the watch design profession arose. In the 1960s, the “watch designer” profession simply did not exist. Only a few “stylists” or “model makers” designed watches, among other everyday objects: chairs, cars, utensils, etc. The first to devote themselves solely to watchmaking and to make a name for themselves – such as Gérald Genta, Jean-Claude Gueit (Piaget) and Jean-Daniel Rubi (Patek Philippe), who paved the way for Jörg Hysek, Emmanuel Gueit, Claude Emmenegger, etc. – were at the start of their careers and still working in the background. Nonetheless, attitudes were beginning to change under the international influence of fashion, design and contemporary art. The Journal Suisse d’Horlogerie, for example, devoted articles to “creative art”, echoing the groundswell of design competitions, which led to the founding of the Académie des Créateurs Indépendants in the 1980s. At Audemars Piguet, the process of creating new models is rather poorly documented before the 1970s, despite the extraordinary creativity deployed since the 1920s–30s. In a small company employing a few dozen people and producing one-off watches or tiny series, projects were born of personal, often informal collaborations, nurtured by friendships between watchmakers and case-makers. The latter, principally based in Geneva (Wenger, Eggly), La Chaux-de-Fonds (Favre-Perret, etc.), Italy (Brera, Ponti, Villa, etc.) or Paris (Jaeger), often created entire case or dial designs for different brands. It was therefore common to find similar watch designs from one brand to another. Some models also stemmed from collaboration with international brands, retailers or jewellers – such as Tiffany, Van Cleef, Bulgari, Gübelin, Cartier and Oscar Heyman – who often signed or co-signed watches. Audemars Piguet sometimes also worked with independent designers, such as the German Gebhard Duve, who created the so-called “Discovolante” 5093 models in the 1950s. Gérald Genta mentioned having sold his first designs to Audemars Piguet in the 1950s. The designer’s name appears in the brand’s archives in 1960, alongside several models combining geometrical shapes in a refined manner, such as Model 5179, the asymmetrical 5182 and the 5199, which plays on textures and shapes. Over the course of the 1960s, the relationship between Genta and Audemars Piguet grew stronger, based on shared values and sensibilities. In his 2011 interview, the designer said: “Everyone has their own taste, their own ‘vibrations’. Those I acquired at Audemars Piguet led me to develop a law of aesthetics and architecture corresponding to something intensely physical. The watch must adapt to the wrist and it has to fit smoothly under a shirt cuff.” He added, “We were like a tandem, Georges Golay and me. If he was in agreement about something and I wasn’t, we didn't make the model... We were in complete symbiosis.” So much so that the two men wore the same watch: Model 5233, featuring a design inspired by an almost completely dissolved bar of soap, the perfect aerodynamic shape. It was between 1967 and 1971 that the relationship reached its highest level of intensity. In 1967, Genta was awarded an honourable mention at the “Prix de Genève” competition for an Audemars Piguet handbag watch. In 1969, 1970 and 1971, Audemars Piguet commissioned Genta to travel to the Basel Fair. Genta said that in addition to welcoming clients on the small AP booth to introduce them to the new products, he was responsible for installing the watches in the display cases and dismantling the latter at the end of the show. Thus, when Georges Golay phoned Gérald Genta on April 10, 1970, they may well have been staying in nearby hotels. Genta was to remember the “4 pm” call from Georges Golay for the rest of his life. He quoted the Managing Director of AP who – with all his powerful intonation, natural authority and beautiful accent from the Vallée de Joux – said: “Mr. Genta, we have a distribution company that has asked us for a steel sports watch that has never been done before – and I need the design sketch for tomorrow morning.” The designer immediately set to work on his drawing board. He explained: “I incorrectly understood him to have said ‘whose water-resistance has never been done before’… I remembered as a child having seen a diver being fitted with a helmet on Geneva’s Pont de la Machine. I was very impressed when I saw the eight bolts and the rubber seal designed to protect a person’s life under water. I was tempted to fit a highly prestigious movement inside a case entirely recalling the diver’s helmet. Furthermore, I designed the integrated bracelet which was unprecedented, with tapering intermediate links that made it extremely hard to produce; the dial with hands and hour-markers delicately inlaid with luminous material; the sunburst cobalt blue dial base adorned with Clous de Paris guilloché pattern, complete with a smoky effect as the shade would otherwise have been slightly commonplace.” “All that was already laid out on the first sketch! The octagonal shape was obviously due to the fitting of the eight screws, because I had to find the space in the bezel to place them all. It is essential to point out that this new seal was an extremely substantial lip-type seal, located between the bezel and the monocoque (monohull) case. The latter already existed but only in very cheap products.” &quot;The screws were hexagonal because the screw heads were embedded in the bezel, so that they would not turn when locking from beneath. I had to come up with all that in one night! It was a crazy thing, personally I don’t know by what magic it was possible to create such a thing in one night, it was quite amazing!” Before retracing the stages in the Royal Oak’s creation, let’s take a look at its sources of inspiration and the myths and legends to which it has given rise. The Royal Oak’s aesthetics were nourished by numerous influences. It followed on naturally from the Audemars Piguet watches of the 1930s to 1960s with their extraordinary design and drew on the developments in contemporary architecture of the 1960s to 1970s. It was part of a cultural groundswell that was sweeping the world of contemporary art, architecture and music. Many hypotheses have been put forward regarding the symbolic meaning of the Royal Oak, often based on parallels drawn with existing objects. One of the most popular is that the shape of the bezel and its eight screws reinterprets the gunports of some of the British fleet’s ‘Royal Oak’ warships. Nonetheless, the latter were in fact never octagonal or secured by eight screws. Not to mention the fact that the name Royal Oak was chosen more than a year and a half after the watch was first designed. More on this later. We have just seen that Gérald Genta claimed to have been inspired by a diving helmet he saw during his childhood. While the link with water-resistance is undeniable, the octagonal shape definitely stems from another source (was there ever such a thing as an eight-bolt diving helmet?). In this respect, Martin K. Wehrli, former Director of the Audemars Piguet Museum, and other witnesses from the same period noted the existence of an innocuous object found in the small Audemars Piguet offices at No. 2 Rue Vallin in Geneva: a parcel-weighing machine with a rounded octagonal form. Should we view this as a potential indirect influence? Perhaps. Olivier Audemars, Vice-Chairman of Audemars Piguet’s Board of Directors and representing the fourth generation of the founding families, explains that the visible screws are a powerful symbol. He recalls that displaying them was a disruptive act in 1972, a manifesto expressing mechanical resistance, technicality and solidity. Opening the case is indeed a mystery worthy of a safe, since it is impossible to turn an embedded hexagonal screw! The metaphor of the safe (in the land of banks) is all the more relevant in that the ultra-resistant steel case housed a partially gold movement. By protecting a mechanical and traditional treasure in an era when quartz technology was threatening the entire industry, the Royal Oak became a watchmaking hero. A related interpretation is found in the theme of the ennoblement of steel. The finest artisans did indeed dignify the commonplace metal of a watch, raising it to a higher status. This act recalls another that took place 400 years earlier: Charles II of England ennobled the oak tree that saved his life in battle against Cromwell. The echo makes all the more sense in that the watch was named after the tree! In the same vein, some texts associate the steel of the watch with that of the English Royal Oak battleships... Nonetheless, a careful look at the Royal Oak indicates that the octagonal shape purely reflects the pursuit of aesthetic refinement. Genta said that the eight hexagonal screws imposed a wide bezel. To trim it down, the designer reduced the width between each screw, creating the eight faces. But why eight? Probably so that the two lateral sides would fit perfectly into the tonneau-shaped case – and also in order for the upper and lower parts to surround the dial in a harmonious way, ensuring their screws were aligned with the bracelet studs. It was certainly also to refine the aesthetics of the watch that Genta bevelled a third of the bezel surface. Genta was first and foremost a jeweller and some see the light effects created by the instantly recognisable facets of the case and bracelet, mirror-polished and satin-finished by hand, as an evocation of the facets of a diamond. Each person has made the Royal Oak their own according to their own sensibility and aspirations. When asked about his sources of inspiration, Gérald Genta explained: “Creative design is first of all an unconscious observation of everything around you. Your brain stores this data and, by force of circumstance, creation is a contestation since it involves making something that does not exist. It is thus both an observation and a contestation.” On April 11, 1970, while Gérald Genta was installing the watches in the windows of the tiny Audemars Piguet booth at the Basel Fair, George Golay presented his sketches. Carlo de Marchi and his companions were won over. When the Managing Director told Genta the good news, the latter made an unusual request: &quot;This is so special that I would like to monitor the making of the prototype. Please tell me which company I will need to visit.” He later explained: “I had a very precise idea in my head and I knew what I wanted to do.” The approach was unusual in that Jacques-Louis Audemars – grandson of the co-founder of Audemars Piguet and Chairman of the Board of Directors at the time – was not only in charge of production but also personally managed all new developments. Genta first went to the small watchmaking town of La Chaux-de-Fonds to discuss the project with watch case manufacturer Favre &amp; Perret. This company founded in 1865 and bought up by the Swatch Group in 1999 was specialised in gold watch cases and jewellery. It had never worked with steel. While the fact that Georges Golay had imposed such a partner surprised the designer, this choice was entirely judicious, since fine workmanship, top-of-the-range decorations and craftsmanship were the core values of this traditional firm. There were two remaining challenges: convincing the Favre-Perret craftspeople to move out of their comfort zone and work steel with the same meticulous care as gold; and developing an unprecedented water-resistant monocoque case architecture. Gérald Genta was apparently told: “Sir, it won’t work.” Warming to the subject, the designer insisted: “It was a revolution! It was something incredible!” He went on to explain the design in more detail: “The rubber seal must obviously have a circular rim on top with two raised ramps… The bezel was quite wide, there had to be room for the screw heads and to ensure the body of the screw did not impinge on this water-resistance gasket.” The structure of the monocoque case was so innovative and special that the decision was quickly taken to make the prototypes in white gold. On June 16, 1970, four prototypes were ordered from Favre-Perret in a letter that interestingly – and in a rare occurrence – bore the letterhead of Audemars Piguet but was signed by Gérald Genta, despite the fact that he was never an Audemars Piguet employee and always proclaimed his independence. Moreover, the letter requests an offer for 1,000 watches in steel and 100 in gold. These were quantities unheard of at Audemars Piguet (Genta explained that 1,000 units was a minimum to make a steel watch profitable), but also proof that gold was still an option. While the Tapisserie dial is one of the most important aesthetic codes of the Royal Oak, it would not have seen the light of day without a surprising conjunction of circumstances. Helmut Crott, a renowned collector, entrepreneur and founder of the eponymous auction house, told this story in his book The Dial. The Face of the Wristwatch in the 20th Century, published in 2020. It all began when, around 1970, a Geneva-based company called La Nationale lost its only employee capable of operating seven old machines that were about to fall into disuse. These engraving machines, or more precisely &quot;guilloché copying&quot; machines, had been used for decades to reproduce geometric or floral tapisserie patterns on gold lighters, pens or cigarette boxes in silver, gold, etc. Wishing to dispose of these tools, La Nationale handed them over to its neighbour, the dial-maker Stern Frères, on condition that they fulfil an existing order. Stern was nothing less than the most prestigious dial manufacturer of the 20th century. It supplied the greatest watch brands, including Patek Phillippe (which the Stern family bought in 1932), Vacheron Constantin and Audemars Piguet. Roland Tille was the Stern Frères head of design at the time. He understood the potential of these old tools, despite the great difficulty involved in using them. When Gérald Genta visited him to talk about the future Royal Oak, Tille showed him not only the machines, but also the 300 templates that came with them, each featuring a different design. The two men chose 13 designs to make prototypes, including one called T21, standing for “Tapisserie 21”. That was the one chosen for the Royal Oak. Now renamed Petite Tapisserie, this pattern is composed of hundreds of small truncated pyramids, punctuated by tens of thousands of small diamond-shaped holes, enabling subtle and unique light effects.   In contrast to the guilloché pattern, the colour was already defined on Gérald Genta’s original design. Colouring a surface as complex as the Petite Tapisserie represented a major technical challenge, as the colour must neither detract from its innumerable tiny details, nor excessively dim the light effects. Painting would have blocked the tiny diamond-shaped holes. The natural choice was the electroplating technique that involved applying an extremely thin layer of colour to the dial. The artisans at Stern were nonetheless well aware that blue was the most difficult colour to obtain consistently using this process. Even if the duration of the baths is controlled to the nearest second, the mixtures to the nearest drop and the temperatures to the nearest degree, it is impossible to guarantee an identical colour for each dial series. The first Royal Oak dials were handcrafted and may vary slightly in colour, as may the guilloché work. After galvanic treatment, each dial must be protected against oxidation by means of an almost transparent lacquer, often called zapon by craftspeople. In the Stern archives, the dial of Model 5402 (the first Royal Oak) is described as “Bleu Nuit 1 + N50”. The N50 indication meant Nuage 50 (cloud 50), the cloud being produced by the small amount of black colour poured into the liquid lacquer before it was applied to the blue dial. To equip the future Royal Oak, Audemars Piguet and Gérald Genta chose the world’s thinnest mechanical selfwinding movement with date: the famous Calibre 2121 derived from the 2120. At 3.05 mm thick and 12½ lignes (28 mm) in diameter, this now legendary calibre corresponds to what watchmakers colloquially call a tracteur (tractor), in that it combined power with reliability and resistance, despite its extreme thinness. Calibre 2120 was born in 1967 from the collaboration of three renowned companies, which by then had forged close links in terms of both production and distribution: LeCoultre &amp; Cie, Audemars Piguet and Vacheron Constantin. A letter dated June 9, 1964, sent by Audemars Piguet to its main supplier of ébauches, LeCoultre &amp; Cie, informs us of the importance of the issue but also of the difficulties of realisation: “For three or four years now, we have been making our customers wait, as they are less and less able to understand why the specialists in extra-thin and luxury watches are still offering automatic watches that are among the thickest.” Coordination meetings were held at the highest levels of the three companies. On August 19, 1966, for example, Jacques-Louis Audemars, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Creative Director of Audemars Piguet, met at the LeCoultre Manufacture with André Goy, Deputy General Manager of Vacheron Constantin, Jean Lebet, Technical Director of LeCoultre &amp; Cie, and Maurice Audemars, who is generally credited with the creation of Calibres 2003 and 2120. In 1967, the Audemars Piguet 5271 Model was the first to be equipped with Calibre 2120. Its central weight on rollers (patented system) was signed “Audemars-Piguet” and its total thickness was 2.45 mm. Designed by Genta, it was followed by more than 10 models the same year. From then on, this calibre played a major role in Audemars Piguet production, equipping more than 650 watches as of 1967. Launched in 1970, its derivative 2121 added the date function, which slightly increased its thickness to 3.05 mm. It equipped all Royal Oak “Jumbo” watches until the end of 2021. The Royal Oak bracelet designed by Genta was far from the first integrated steel bracelet. It was however the most complex ever made from this material and featured 154 components, among which 34 were of different sizes. Its aesthetics and technicality enabled it to unite two previously separate worlds: craftsmanship, stemming from the history of jewellery, in which Audemars Piguet had excelled for several decades; and steel sports bracelets, stemming from collections of water-resistant watches produced in very large series by companies such as Omega or Rolex. The aim was to manufacture the first ever sports bracelet in accordance with the rules of artistic craftsmanship. To make such an achievement possible, Audemars Piguet turned to one of the greatest specialists: the Geneva-based company Gay Frères. Founded in 1835 by Jean-Pierre Gay and Gaspar Tissot, this company initially specialised in chains but reconverted to watch bracelets in the 20th century. It made a name for itself by cooperating with Rolex (which bought it up in 1998), for which it notably manufactured the Oyster bracelet, as well as with the main Swiss watch firms, including Patek Philippe (for its rice grain bracelet) and Chopard. In the 1970s, Gay Frères was the undisputed master of steel bracelets. Its Geneva workshops employed more than 500 people, five times more than Audemars Piguet. Despite their experience and the quality of their tools, the Gay Frères artisans were never able to attain the level of Audemars Piguet’s finishing requirements. Thus, like the cases produced by Favre-Perret, each bracelet had to be reworked manually by the Le Brassus watchmakers during the casing-up process. Even after the 1972 launch, several improvements had to be made to achieve the expected degree of quality and ergonomics, in particular to ensure the perfect tapering of the links attached to the case. As the Royal Oak collection grew, several other firms took on this ambitious and delicate production, including Fontana, Lascor, GTF and then Centror, which is currently the Audemars Piguet Meyrin subsidiary. By April 1971, a full year had passed since Genta’s first sketch. As the Basel Fair was about to open, Georges Golay took advantage of the presence of the “three musketeers” to discreetly introduce them to the future Royal Oak’s white gold prototype. It was immediately clear that Audemars Piguet had something which would create a stir! Carlo de Marchi and Charles Bauty each agreed to buy 400 units, making a total of 800 watches. Georges Golay decided to produce a first series of 1,000 in steel, assuming that it would be easy to distribute the 200 additional examples to the rest of the world. The development took another year and was done without Gérald Genta. An entrepreneur at heart, Genta had long wanted to step out of the shadows and create his own brand. In 1969, he had already taken a first step in this direction: “I had already secretly prepared my collection and on December 25, 1969 I arranged a meeting with the Fred company which placed an order for 120 watches. Relations with Audemars Piguet ended in 1972 when Gérald Genta presented in Basel the first model from his brand: a wooden watch with a bezel punctuated by 13 gold screws. On May 19, 1971, Jacques-Louis Audemars signed an order for 1,000 steel cases from Favre-Perret. This was the largest quantity of a single model ever ordered by Audemars Piguet. To better understand what such a figure represents, one should recall that in 1971, the 6,217 watches sold by AP were available in 237 very different models and that each model was itself interpreted in a multitude of different dials and materials. Only 23 models were produced in quantities of more than 100, while 145 models had less than 10 units each, 55 of which were one-offs. We now know that the first Royal Oak, Model 5402, was produced in a run of over 6,000 watches. However, back in 1971, the idea of making even 1,000 of them was perceived as excessive and even shocking by certain craftspeople in Le Brassus, and doubtless also by some of the brand’s traditional customers. Several sources, including Gérald Genta and Martin K. Wehrli, former Director of the Audemars Piguet Museum, claim that Georges Golay had initially planned to limit the total production of Model 5402 to 1,000 units, which would have made the Royal Oak Audemars Piguet’s first limited edition. According to Genta, the success of the watch forced Georges Golay to betray his word by subsequently increasing production: “Golay was sick of continuing to produce Royal Oak watches, because it made him a liar. He was a man of exceptional quality.” What do the archives say? The first case order clearly states that each watch should have a special engraving on the caseback: “Please provide a special numbering from 1 to 1,000 below 6 o’clock.” It is interesting to note that Audemars Piguet modified the numbering system of the watches as soon as the Royal Oak was created, adding the “small number”, a consecutive number starting with 1 and intended for a single model. This subject is developed in another article dedicated to the Royal Oak’s numbering system. But Georges Golay did not limit production to 1,000. Without abandoning the idea of a limited series, he elegantly freed himself from the constraints of this concept. An advertising text from 1972 is enlightening in this respect: “Chaque exemplaire des séries limitées de Royal Oak est numéroté” (Each watch in Royal Oak limited series is numbered). On the one hand, the copy indicates that the production is limited, but does not provide a definite number. Moreover, the French term séries limitées is in the plural and that accounts for how the A, B, C and D series of Model 5402 came into being. On December 6, 1971, almost a year and a half after the first design, Audemars Piguet officially filed patent application 17724\u002F71 with the Swiss Federal Office of Intellectual Property. Gérald Genta was listed as the inventor. The patent, entitled “Water-resistant watch case,” was published in September 1974 and granted in January 1975. It protected “a water-resistant watch case based on a particularly simple and efficient construction and featuring a new aesthetic appearance.” The text mentions the risks of water infiltration around the screws, but it does not yet indicate that the latter would be made of gold to avoid oxidation. Naming a new watch is always a tricky process. The name must convey values, evoke a history, a character, a rich and relevant semantic universe, yet it must also be memorable and pronounceable throughout the world. For Audemars Piguet in 1971, the search for a name was further complexified by the fact that the brand had never done this for any previous series-made watch. Until then, the only element of recognition was the model reference number or the nickname given by collectors. In May 1971, Audemars Piguet’s new octagonal watch was given a working name that evoked lion-hunting. In his case order, Jacques-Louis Audemars used the term “Safari”. Denys Capt, the watchmaker who helped develop the model, remembers that the name “Excalibur” was also mentioned. As for Genta, he would have liked to refer to the diving suit that had inspired him and was at the origin of the water-resistance patent (he would succeed a few years later with the Nautilus). But this idea came up against several limits. Firstly, the world of diving watches entered its first golden age in the 1960s, opening up a new sports segment. A diver’s watch must meet a standard technical definition, only partially met by the future Royal Oak despite its water resistance to 100 metres. Secondly and far more importantly, the watch – with its complex aesthetics, extreme finesse, as well as hand decoration including numerous satin-finished and polished facets and guilloché dial – was much more than a diving watch, much more than a sports watch! On September 13, 1971, the question of the name was still far from resolved, as indicated in a meeting report: “The Safari watch:... look for names evoking sport, wide open spaces or virility (with related slogans). Various suggestions: Grand Prix – Diane – Surfrider – Colorado – Kilimanjaro – Canyon – Oxford – Ascot – Yale – etc.” It was not until December 2, 1971 that the name Royal Oak appeared in the brand’s archives. All the witnesses of the time agree that the Italian agent Carlo de Marchi came up with the name which referred to the Royal Oak ships of the Royal Navy, the most recent of which were armoured in metal. It was also a nod to the story of Charles II, King of England, who owed his life to an oak tree that had sheltered him from Cromwell’s troops and which he subsequently ennobled. “Royal Oak” opens the door to countless interpretations, carrying connotations of equestrian and naval battles, the conquest of the oceans, treasures hidden in safes, kings in peril, noble armour and life-saving trees: a name open to the world and brimming with stories. To support the launch of the Royal Oak, Audemars Piguet decided to create a dedicated campaign. Here again, the approach was unprecedented. Until then advertising campaigns had been brand-based and usually featured multiple products. In the early 1970s, the brand image was not yet unified. On the one hand, in the main markets, the agents and the most important retailers created their own advertising campaigns. In the French market, for example, Audemars Piguet’s advertising was managed by De Trevars \u002F Vacheron Constantin. These campaigns were deployed locally, meaning that the brand identity often varied from one market to another. In parallel, Audemars Piguet tasked advertising agencies in Switzerland with creating international campaigns. There were not yet any marketing teams in Le Brassus, even in embryonic form. Promotion was handled directly by Georges Golay, who managed the advertising agencies and even corresponded with the newspapers carrying adverts! During the 1960s, Audemars Piguet actively cooperated with the Lausanne-based agency TRIO Advertising, a pioneer in watch advertising and marketing in Switzerland and publisher of the Journal Suisse d’Horlogerie, the official press organ of the Basel Fair. But at the end of that decade, Georges Golay had to change partners. The archives do not explain this change of heart, but the context allows us to suggest a hypothesis. TRIO was very close to the powerful SSIH. However, after the 1969 distribution agreement between AP and SSIH (see above), it is likely that Georges Golay decided to change advertising partners in order to retain more room for manoeuvre, i.e. not to put all his eggs in one basket. Like many others, the decision was probably taken during a game of cards between friends. One could easily imagine that the participants included a certain Gilbert Maillard, an advertising executive running the Hugo Buchser agency that promoted the ski jumping championships in Le Brassus, of which Georges Golay was the president and one of the major promoters. At the time, the family company founded in 1927 and known today as Europa Star HBM S.A., still bore the name of its ebullient founder Hugo Buchser (1896–1961). This extraordinary entrepreneur, founder of the Transmarine watch brand, publisher, merchant and tireless traveller notably launched numerous watch magazines in South America, Asia, Africa, Spain, Switzerland, as well as Middle-East and Portugal. After his death in 1961, the company was managed by his son-in-law Gilbert Maillard who, in addition to being a friend of Georges Golay, was a former schoolmate of Gérald Genta. While Hugo Buchser was primarily a publishing house, part of its team offered advertising agency services: photographs, slogans, graphic design, advertisements, distribution strategy, etc. This activity was to grow to such an extent that in 1975, Gilbert Maillard and Heinz Heimann divided it up to found an independent advertising agency that was to promote Audemars Piguet until 1998. But let’s get back to the late 1960s. From 1969 to1971, Hugo Buchser’s campaigns clarified and reinvigorated Audemars Piguet’s image, giving pride of place to the oversized AP logo, bright colours – green, gold, blue – and products. From this period onwards and for 20 years, the predominant slogan was “La plus prestigieuse des signatures” (“The most prestigious of signatures”). A concept as strong as the Royal Oak is a rare treat for an advertising agency! The Royal Oak logo was probably refined in Buchser’s offices. The team then began to work on the texts. In February 1972, the message was already clearly taking shape: “Demanding men of action are no longer satisfied with standard sports watches. They are always on the move and demand more: a perfect watch, in complete harmony with the multiple activities of their exciting lives. For this elite, AUDEMARS PIGUET’s artist-watchmakers have created the ROYAL OAK, a tribute to steel, the metal of the cathedrals of our time, more resistant to tools than fine gold and rendered infinitely precious by the unparalleled quality of its workmanship.” Until April 1972, fine-tuning continued on the texts, photographs, leaflets and advertisements, emphasising the qualities of the ultra-thin movement, the octagonal shape, the hexagonal screws, etc. Yet the two elements dominating the messages of the advertising campaign were, on the one hand, the “tribute to steel” and, on the other hand, the capacity of the watch to unite the worlds of design, sport, know-how, innovation... This represented a metaphor for the modern world and the personality of the customers for whom the watch was intended. It is worth recalling that the Range Rover had just made a similar mark on the automotive world of the time. It was not until early 1973 that messages telling the story of Charles II, the Royal Oak, Cromwell and the naval vessels of the Royal Navy were themed in a dedicated booklet. According to a document dated September 13, 1972, Audemars Piguet’s overall advertising budget for 1972 amounted to CHF 950,000, more than half of which was for press advertisements. The document does not specify the share dedicated to the Royal Oak, but it definitely greatly exceeded the 6-7% of production and turnover generated by this watch in 1972. The document highlights another significant fact about the organisational system prevailing back then: “it would be worth knowing the amounts devoted to advertising by AP customers worldwide.” The customers here are importers, agents and retailers. The development of the Royal Oak continued well beyond its launch, but the last few months before Basel 1972 were memorable. The tension was palpable, as was a certain feverishness, even to the point of bad temper. Wilfred Berney recounts in a document written in 2020 that the watch was perceived then as “a monster... bearing no relation to what we did and knew how to do”, namely miniaturisation and openworking. The feeling was: “what does this big steel timepiece have to do with our collection? According to our executives, it is the Italian market that is asking for a different watch, sporty and in steel. If, on top of all the rest it’s the Italians calling the shots now... we are losing all control!” Watchmaker Fredy Capt, who took part in this adventure, says he assembled the first steel prototypes &quot;without any real plan, guided by instinct.” He recalls that the first hexagonal screws were made of stainless steel, “not so stainless after all given that they often rusted, making it impossible to dismantle the case. As for the angles, they were so clean-cut that they became downright sharp: “the watchmakers had to soften the angles by hand, with a burnisher.” It was not uncommon for him and his colleagues to take a few more parts and components home in the evenings to be “tweaked”... Fredy Capt’s workshop was next to the offices of Jacques-Louis Audemars and Georges Golay. He recalls that the latter, a keen cigar enthusiast, arrived one morning with a gloomy expression on his face: “I think we’re crazy. We will never sell steel watches at this price!”, adding: “If we don’t sell them, we’ll recover the movements and scrap the cases and bracelets.” In a company employing a total of 84 people, the presence of a homologation laboratory was not on the agenda. To test the watch’s water resistance, Fredy Capt remembers that Jacques-Louis Audemars placed a jar on his windowsill with a label stating “salt water corresponding to the saltiest seas in the world”, and that a Royal Oak watch hung inside. By April 12, 1972 in Le Brassus, the Basel Fair was due to open three days later. Paul Heizmann, head of the casing-up workshop, personally took charge of casing-up the first 20 Royal Oak watches, nos. 67001 to 67020. The even numbers were destined for Italomega, the odd numbers for Gameo. Four of them travelled to Basel. In a document dating from 2020, watchmaker Wilfred Berney recalls the major difficulties encountered in the early years, notably with the clasps that were perceived as too large, the tapering shape of the bracelets which had to be compensated for by adding studs and the scarcity of additional links. But above all, he says that the 8 screws were originally made of steel. However, the seawater seeped in, “coating the screws with its saline content” which attacked, corroded and ended up sticking to the case: “Genta’s famous diving helmet is blocked. Nobody inside, fortunately!” A solution was found to replace the steel screws with gold ones, which are insensitive to corrosion. It was implemented as early as 1972 on parts leaving production. For customer returns, it took all the ingenuity of the watchmakers, who occasionally created new tools and managed to restore the watches to their original condition. Wilfred Berney explains that, although water found its way around the screws, it very rarely reached the movement, which was protected by an oversized seal that ensures a water tightness of 100 metres. A study of the casing-up records confirms this quality. Out of the first 100 Royal Oak watches sold in 1972, only four came back until 1982 for water-resistance problems. The few teething problems of the Royal Oak were thus resolved fairly quickly, allowing the collection to flourish. Before moving on to the launch of the watch, let’s take a moment to focus on its price positioning. This is the aspect that most shocked the watch industry, perhaps because the price of the Royal Oak was sometimes published in the advertisements of the era. In 1972, the Royal Oak sold CHF 3,300. Over time and according to the titles, the amount varied a little, hovering between CHF 3,650 and 3,750 (1975), GBP 756 (1974) and GBP 1,100 (1976) and USD 1,950 (1976). If we compare these amounts to the price of contemporary steel watches, the contrast is striking. In the absence of primary sources, we will resort to testimony from those involved at the time and collectors. In his Royal Oak guide published in July 2016, Marco Stanghellini wrote: “In Italy, the Rolex Submariner was less than a third of this price, and the IWC Ingenieur less than a quarter.” In an interview with Constantin Stikas in 2009, Gérald Genta said: “The most expensive steel watch at the time cost CHF 850.” In actual fact, despite its steel case, the Royal Oak was as expensive as some gold watches. Or even more. In the Audemars Piguet 1972 catalogue, for example, the yellow gold Model 5043, equipped with ultra-thin Calibre 2003 was listed at CHF 2,990. Rather than ignore it, the Hugo Buchser agency decided to use the Royal Oak’s very high price as a hook for a strong message. Some of the ads challenged readers: “What makes steel more valuable than gold?”; “Would you buy a Rembrandt for its canvas”; “Steel at the price of gold”; “The costliest steel watch in the world”. The copy went on to explain that the price of the Royal Oak stemmed from the extreme complexity involved in producing its case and its ultra-thin selfwinding Calibre 2121, a masterpiece of miniaturisation. The texts highlight the work of the artisans, the rarity and delicacy of traditional skills. “Steel has been given its letters of nobility from the hands of Audemars Piguet designers.” The message was understood and appreciated. So much so that in 1974, a brochure for retailers was entitled “Why is Audemars Piguet the costliest watch in the world?” While its content went far beyond the Royal Oak, the same argument was used to celebrate craftspeople’s work. These arguments are echoed by Patek Philippe in 1976 when the Geneva-based watchmaker presented its Nautilus watch as “One of the most expensive watches in the world is made of steel&quot;, highlighting “the skilled hands of master craftsmen” and the versatility of a “formal or festive” watch sold for GBP 1,400. In 1972, the Basel Watch Fair inaugurated its fifth hall and now covered 20,000 m2. For the first time, it welcomed French, German, English and Italian brands, which led it to be renamed “European Watch and Jewellery Fair” the following year. Located in Hall 1, Audemars Piguet’s booth No. 545 spanned barely 60 m2, like that of Rolex. It was located opposite the Longines booth, which was twice as large, and the SSIH stand, which was four times bigger. Alongside Vacheron Constantin and Jaeger-LeCoultre, the watchmaker from Le Brassus was in good company. The Audemars Piguet archives show that the four Royal Oak models presented to the professional watchmaking world and to the public at the time bore case numbers 67002 to 67004, small numbers 2 to 4. On the other hand, these records do not contain any reports on the exhibition, nor any orders or direct testimony relating to the Royal Oak, nor even a photograph of the booth or the display cases. Entirely absent from the Journal Suisse d’Horlogerie, the Royal Oak landed just two captioned photos in Europa Star. Even more surprisingly, when Georges Golay wrote his 1972 annual report to the Audemars Piguet Board of Directors on May 3, 1973, he ignored the newcomer: “As far as products were concerned, nothing much changed in 1972.” The silence was apparently deafening. Nonetheless, several witnesses from the time recall that the watch caused a sensation. In 2006, Jacqueline Dimier, who created most of the AP models between 1975 and 1999, remembers: “That spring, many of us from all walks of life crowded into the Audemars Piguet showcases at the Basel Fair. Surprised and stunned, we realised without any clear explanation that a step was being taken that was at last connecting traditional watchmaking to an industrial aesthetic of the future.” Gérald Genta recounted that Pierre-Alain Blum, then head of Ebel, came to see him: “I would like to congratulate you because I have just come from Audemars Piguet, where I have ordered the Royal Oak for my friend Perrin.” At that time, Blum was making the entire must-have collection for Cartier, a company run by Alain Dominique Perrin. Above and beyond the watchmaking microcosm, the Royal Oak had already won over one of the greatest collectors of his era: the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had seen a preview of the prototype and just ordered the first model in white gold, as well as many others in steel for his entourage. Not all reviews were glowing. While critics left no written trace – since social media did not yet exist – those involved back in the day sometimes drop a hint that the watch created a scandal in the hushed world of Haute Horlogerie. When Georges Golay addressed the Swiss market in March 1973, he discreetly recalled that “this watch has people talking about Audemars Piguet”, and mentioned “the scepticism of certain clients.” In 1992, Martin K. Wehrli stated in the Audemars Piguet monograph: “The professional world reacted with scepticism to the Manufacture’s announcement of the market launch of this stainless steel wristwatch at a price of 3,650 Swiss francs.” Gérald Genta also said that “It was not a demonstration of success...”. In a 2013 interview, Jasmine Audemars confirmed that “At the beginning, the Royal Oak attracted a lot of criticism”, as it “stepped outside the codes of the time.” In an unpublished memoir written by Martin K. Wehrli in 2017, who in 1972 was responsible for sales, recounts that the first buyer of the watch was “Ron Smith, acting on behalf of Garrard in London.” This supplier by appointment to Her Majesty is said to have confined himself to this laconic comment: &quot;”Royal Oak is a pub name here.” The same document states that “Number one was not delivered until July 8, 1974 to a director of Harry Winston; the watch bore the case number 67001 and the movement number 127006.” The first few months were rather chaotic. Large production was a major challenge, a real baptism of fire. Not only were component deliveries running late, but each assembly required endless rework. Of the 20 timepieces completed in April, the first five were delivered to the Italian market on May 2, but only 10 watches were cased-up throughout the entire month. June proved more productive, with 95 units, but this figure fell to eight watches in July. Little by little, the craftspeople overcame the difficulties and from August onwards, the rate of delivery increased significantly. So much so that by the end of 1972, the workshops had produced an impressive total of 565 Royal Oak watches, 490 of which had been delivered! Thus, in barely eight months after its launch, Model 5402 had already broken the record for the number of identical units of a model sold in one year. Had the gamble paid off? All that remained was for retailers to sell the watches to end customers... before ordering new ones from Le Brassus. Since the 2010s, the original commercial failure of the Royal Oak has become a widespread misconception, albeit belied by historical facts. In their book published for the Royal Oak’s 40th anniversary, Martin K. Wehrli and Heinz Heimann recalled: “It even took the two main markets a full three years to sell their quotas of 400... Then one day, in 1974, Giovanni Agnelli, industrial magnate and the boss of FIAT appeared in public with a Royal Oak on his wrist. From one day to the next, the watch began to enjoy unprecedented success, and the amazing story truly began.” Other sources tell a different story. In March 1973, Georges Golay described the Royal Oak as a “best seller”. In May 1973, he wrote: “The Royal Oak has proved that the purchasing motivations of part of our clientele have changed.” On August 22, he increased the advertising budget by 50%. At the same time, he hired an engineer to create the Technical Department and launched the expansion of the Manufacture. Audemars Piguet’s turnover rose from 13 million in 1973 to 18 million the following year, then to 25 million in 1975. In an interview dated February 6, 1982, George Golay said of the Royal Oak: “It was an instant success.” As for the Audemars Piguet book published by Flammarion in 2011, it speaks of a “very great commercial success” which forced the company to “change scale and renew its traditional processes.” What do the figures say? After coming close in 1972, the Royal Oak passed the 500 mark in 1973. It reached 618 units the following year and stabilised slightly below 600 until 1976, before increasing with the arrival of the gold versions, to reach 820 watches in 1978. While these figures may seem modest 50 years on, they were remarkable for the period. From the launch of the watch in 1972 and during the first years of its commercialisation, the Swiss market absorbed between 150 and 200 watches per year, as did Asia. The Royal Oak found an audience in Germany. While it enjoyed modest yet growing success in France, the surprise came from Italy. Carlo de Marchi, one of the key minds behind the Royal Oak, struggled to distribute it, confirming Genta’s testimony. In 1972, 89 watches were delivered to Italomega. This figure dropped to 35 in 1973, then barely 31 the following year, painfully rising to 36 and 44 watches in 1975 and 1976. According to the Audemars Piguet commercial archives, the Italian market only sold just over half of the 400 timepieces ordered in 1971. Was there a “Gianni Agnelli effect”? While it definitely made its mark on people’s memories, the commercial impact is less likely. There is however still one unknown factor, since it is not impossible that certain Italian retailers came to buy watches directly in Switzerland... Whatever the case, the Royal Oak conquered the Italian market from 1976 to 1977 in its gold or two-tone smaller 29 and 35 mm versions (Models 8638, 4100 and variations). Thus, despite the criticism, but also thanks to the debates it sparked, the Royal Oak was an undeniable commercial success from the outset. So much so that the A series, which was to be limited to 1,000 units, was eventually extended to 2,000. In 1975, Audemars Piguet launched the B series, followed the next year by the C series and finally the D series in December 1978. A total of 6,050 Model 5402 watches were sold, including 4,288 in steel, 876 in two-tone gold and steel, 736 in yellow gold, and 150 in white gold. More importantly, the Royal Oak was enriched in 1976 with a version for women, Model 8638 designed by Jacqueline Dimier, followed by Model 4100 endowed with a smaller diameter and a central seconds hand. Dozens of variations in materials, dimensions and levels of complications followed as the Royal Oak collection took shape. In the wake of the new icon, numerous models inspired by the Royal Oak spirit were created throughout the Swiss watch industry. Genta recounted that a few years later, he was commissioned by Patek Philippe to design another steel watch, the Nautilus. In the same spirit, the Genevan designer revisited the IWC Ingenieur in 1976 and other designers were inspired by the Royal Oak to evolve watchmaking. One example is the Overseas 222 model designed by Jörg Hysek, launched by Vacheron Constantin in 1977. More than a watch, the Royal Oak is an object of design and culture, a symbol of its time. In 1972, it reinvented the codes of luxury watchmaking. Born at the heart of a profound cultural and artistic revolution, at the dawn of the worst crisis in the Swiss watch industry, exacerbated by the financial and oil crises, it was nurtured by multiple influences. Each actor involved in its genesis enriched it: the SSIH agents perceived clients’ new sensitivities and challenged Audemars Piguet to respond. Georges Golay was able to inspire each actor in the creative process. Gérald Genta designed his masterpiece in one night. The best dial-makers, watchmakers, case-makers and advertisers enriched, refined, fleshed out and fine-tuned the Royal Oak, contributing their talents, know-how and passion to create an extraordinary watch, rich in tradition but looking to the future. In 1982, George Golay summed up the reasons behind its success: “I think it is beautiful, elegant and sporty in appearance, whereas watches up until now were either very elegant or very sporty.” In other words, the Royal Oak is probably the watch industry’s first example of sporting chic.

After the warranty period, the object is often cheaper to replace than to repair. At Audemars Piguet, as with the major Haute Horlogerie brands, it is, on the contrary, when a watch leaves the workshops that its story really begins. Designed to operate for decades, even centuries, a watch regularly returns to the bench for service or repair. In a best-case scenario, this takes place in the Audemars Piguet workshops. Very often, however, it passes through the hands of other watchmakers who repair it according to the tools available, their stock of components and their experience. Not to mention certain collectors who venture to open it up themselves! For Audemars Piguet, it is essential to be able to identify its creations at any time, whatever their condition. Watchmakers must be able to recognise their &quot;offspring&quot;, as this is the only way to restore these models to their original condition and guarantee their authenticity and functionality for future generations. One of the first ways to recognise a watch is by the numbers engraved on its case and movement. At Audemars Piguet, these numbers have multiplied and expanded over time: calibre numbers, model numbers, bracelet numbers, etc. This codification was created for internal use, meaning essentially the repair and marketing of watches. Although it remained virtually impossible to grasp for the public at large, the collecting community took an interest in it at an early stage, based on an awareness that numbers could testify to the history of a watch, its authenticity or its rarity. The use of engraved numbers goes back to the origins of the company, as can be seen from the registers in the archives which contain all the engraved numbers. These registers began to be kept in 1882 and continue to this day. More or less rich and numerous, depending on the period, they describe each watch produced as well as their type of mechanism and functions, in some cases its exterior, etc. Since the 19th century, each Audemars Piguet movement has had a unique number engraved on the baseplate or on a bridge. This number is carefully transcribed in a Production Register (Registre d’Établissage). The oldest Audemars Piguet register has disappeared, so the documented numbers start in 1882 with the number 2000 and the numbers increase incrementally thereafter. All that is required to identify a watch is to compare the information in the register with that on the watch itself. By way of example, the registers indicate that the number 3824 corresponds to a double complication pocket watch sold in 1890, which is confirmed by examining the watch, which belongs to the Audemars Piguet Heritage Collection (pictured). Another example from the same collection: movement number 30828 corresponds to a miniature minute repeater sold in 1924, which has been on display since 2020 in the Musée Atelier Audemars Piguet in Le Brassus (pictured). Since movement numbers are assigned consecutively, it is tempting for the historian to infer that Audemars Piguet's total production corresponds to the highest movement number of its period. For example, the above-mentioned minute repeater No. 30828 (1924) should be the 30,828th watch made by Audemars Piguet. In other words, the company should have produced more than 30,000 watches in 1924 – whereas an analysis of the records shows that this is not the case. Many numbers were not in fact used. During the first decades of the company's history, only about half of the numbers were allocated. Thus, for example, watch No. 60000 (1956), is only about the 30,000th produced by Audemars Piguet since 1875. Why did watchmakers use only some of the numbers? While that remains a mystery, this practice became increasingly rare from the latter half of the 20th century onwards until it almost disappeared. This meant that when the number of movements was nearing the one-million mark in 2017, the total production stood at around 800,000 units, (thereby corresponding in 142 years to one year’s production by Rolex). Nonetheless, no Audemars Piguet watch movement would ever bear the number 1000000. After the number 999988, the company introduced an alphanumerical numbering system consisting of two letters followed by four digits. The system using six consecutive digits starts with AA0001 to AA9999, before moving on to AB0001, etc. The owner of an Audemars Piguet watch might be tempted to estimate its production date from the movement number. The reasoning seems obvious: since the numbering is consecutive, the chronology should follow the numbers in a linear order. A study of the registers only partially confirms this hypothesis. For example, most of the numbers 20900 to 21000 correspond to watches made around 1918; whereas in the early 1950s, the numbers were in the vicinity of 57000–60000 (see table in the previous paragraph). Once again, there are certain exceptions to the rule. The movement number is not a sufficient means of determining the exact date of a watch. This is partly because while movement blanks were numbered at the time of their acquisition by Audemars Piguet, some were kept for years, even decades, before being finished and cased-up. In addition, some movements have been re-cased several times in different exteriors. An extreme example: the minute repeater wristwatch No. 8712 illustrated on page 73 of the book Audemars Piguet 20th Century Complicated Wristwatches was cased and sold in 1951, yet it contains a calibre produced around 1886. All Audemars Piguet watches have a number engraved on their case, either on the back or on the inside and sometimes both. We will henceforth call this the big case number (as opposed to the small Royal Oak number). For almost 75 years, this number was identical to that of the movement. As each watch was unique, the mechanical heart and its exterior were made for each other. If the number differs, it is because the exterior was made without any direct link to Audemars Piguet. In the early 1950s, as the Western world entered the longest and most spectacular growth phase in its history, Audemars Piguet undertook a modernisation process. One of the consequences of this reorganisation was a modification of the big case number which – for the first time – became independent of the movement number. From now on, Audemars Piguet could purchase series of identical, pre-numbered cases from case manufacturers and pair them freely with movements during casing-up in Le Brassus. Thus, in 1951 for example, the case of the watch containing the 54651 movement bore the engraved number 101. The case numbers were then assigned incrementally: 102, 103, etc. They were hand-written in new documents called Case Registers (Registres des Boîtes). Around 1975–1976, as Audemars Piguet began to approach the number 100000, it decided to refine its numbering system by adding a letter to the beginning of the combination of numbers. The numbering started with the letter B because the first 100,000 or so cases, even if they did not have a letter, were tacitly associated with the letter A of the big case numbers. The big case numbers thus now had a letter followed by a number from 1 to 99,999. For example, the openworked wrist chronograph produced in 1981 with the B61720 case engraving contains the 244108 movement (pictured). The numbering never reached 100,000, perhaps because of the length of the combinations to be engraved on the sometimes small cases. Thus, after number C99999, the next letter starts with number D1 and so on… As far as movement numbers are concerned, the large case numbers provide an initial estimate of the product period but are not sufficient to date a watch accurately (see illustrated table). This numbering continued until 2017, when the letter K was displayed. At that point, the case numbering system changed again to a succession of random numbers and letters. Let's go back to the above-mentioned reorganisation in 1951. Until then, the idea of making two exactly identical watches was inconceivable for Audemars Piguet artisans. Each watch was therefore described separately in small hard-covered notebooks called Registers of Completed Watches (Registres des Montres Complètes). However, on the cusp of the post-war boom period, the increase in production and the expansion of distribution made it necessary to review this modus operandi and the brand decided to produce identical watches in small series. This revolution was accompanied by the introduction of the concept of the watch model, which was new for the company. The model number (sometimes also referred to as the reference number or model number) afforded considerable commercial advantages. For the first time, Audemars Piguet customers could order several examples of the same model! It is important to recall that the company sold its watches to retailers at the time. By publishing small catalogues, booklets and other promotional material presenting the available collections, the brand could thereby also address end customers directly. We have seen that from 1951 onwards, the big case numbers were distinct from the movement numbers, linked by the model. It should be noted that this last number is only very rarely engraved in the watch, but that it always appears in the Case Registers and the Production Registers. It refers to numbered photographs, to catalogues, and then to product sheets that specify the characteristics shared by each watch of the same model. It would be wrong to see in this new system a profound transformation of production methods, which remained essentially hand-crafted. The series remained very limited, generally based on batches of ten to 20 cases, or even less. Audemars Piguet still produced a large number of different calibres and hundreds of models. For example, in 1951, there were at least 15 distinct calibres in production for about 900 watches sold. Thus, the notion of model that appeared at Audemars Piguet stood out from other watch brands of the time that were already industrialised and needed a detailed reference management system. At Audemars Piguet, the model number initially defined only the shape and size of the case. While the material was quickly added, it would take decades for the model number to mention the strap\u002Fbracelet, the finishing or the dial version. Originally composed of four digits, the model numbers created a language of their own. Whereas designating a double-complication pocket watch in 1912 implied describing it in detail, simply naming the reference number of Models 5043, 5402 or 15202 is enough to know which timepiece is being spoken of. A model number is to a watch what a first name is to a person. From the end of the 1950s, watchmakers created categories or families of timepieces in relation to their model number. The numbering began to be structured to the complexity of the watch or its type. A study carried out by the Customer Service Department in 1997 describes these categories in the following terms: N° 4000 to 4999: Men's watches, metal bracelet N° 5000 to 5499: Older models for men N° 5500 to 5599: Complicated watches (pocket watches and wristwatches) N° 5600 to 5799: Pocket watches N° 5800 to 5999: Older models for ladies N° 6000 to 6999: Quartz watches N° 7000 to 7999: Ladies' mechanical watches, leather strap N° 8000 to 9999: Ladies' mechanical watches, metal bracelet In the 1970s, production was further structured, notably with the creation of a Technical Department in 1973. From then on, in the Production Registers and later in certain catalogues, the bracelet reference was added. The metal was also coded and included before or after the reference. &quot;ST&quot; thus means steel, &quot;BA&quot; yellow gold, &quot;BC&quot; white gold and &quot;SA&quot; is a combination of steel and gold. For example, 5002BA means that the 5002 watch is in yellow gold. This system has been enriched right the way through to the 21st century and includes dozens of references, of which the main ones are described in the illustration. Strongly attached to hand-crafted small series, or even one-offs, Audemars Piguet continued to create hundreds of models at such a speed that in the early 1980s, it became clear that with four-digit references, it would not be possible to give different numbers to each new model. Jacques-Louis Audemars and Georges Golay, who were running the company at the time, decided to add a fifth number. The system was introduced to production from 1984–85 and to the catalogues from 1986. All the new references have five digits and the old ones were renamed. Thus, 5402 became 25402, 8638 became 78638, etc. Later christened the &quot;root reference&quot;, this five-digit code served as the basis for expanding and refining the model numbers, which from the early 2000s onwards were gradually given additional codes providing information on the gemsetting, the finishing, the buckle\u002Fclasp, the bracelet, its material and the dial (see table). Launched in 1972, the Royal Oak 5402ST represented a minor revolution in the watchmaking world. Its design, its unusual treatment of steel, its ability to combine sport and craftsmanship, modernity and tradition, overturned the codes of Haute Horlogerie. On a smaller scale, this watch also changed the numbering system of Audemars Piguet watches. To express the rarity and support the value of this model (the first produced in a series of more than 1,000 identical watches), the brand decided to introduce the small Royal Oak number or small case number, whose story is told in a dedicated article. In a few words: the big case number migrates to the inside of the case, making way for an alphanumerical system composed of a letter followed by a number, initially intended for the owner of the watch. A forerunner of the limited-edition concept, this system numbered each model from A1 to A2000, then B1000 to B2000, etc. From 1976 to the end of the 2010s, a simplified version was adopted for all Royal Oak models. Created to guarantee the longevity of watches, the numbering system developed by Audemars Piguet has been expanded since 1875 to meet the changes in the Manufacture, as well as the needs and techniques of its time. The codification underwent its most important overhaul in 2017. The numbering system for movements and cases became alphanumerical, with each number being assigned randomly. The only exception to this system mutation is the model number, which remains untouched, since it is now so deeply embedded in the company's culture, creating a full-fledged language shared both within the walls of Audemars Piguet and in the collectors’ community. Both internally and externally, the degree of initiation into the brand is sometimes measured by the ability to converse by punctuating one's sentences with model references.

What does that mean? Published by Albert Berner in 1961, The Illustrated Professional Dictionary of Horology explains that a watch case has two functions. The first is to protect the precious and fragile mechanical watch movement against dust, damp and shocks. The second is to “give the watch as attractive an appearance as possible, subject to fashion and the taste of the public.” The author then explains that the case of a wristwatch is usually composed of three main superimposed elements: the caseback, the case middle and the bezel. Rubber seals fitted between each of these levels ensure water resistance. This structure is known as a &quot;three-piece&quot; case. While Albert Berner did not define the monocoque case, he introduced a category that prefigured it: the &quot;two-piece&quot; wristwatch-case in which the lugs and case middle merge to form a single component. This structure reduces the risk of moisture penetration, makes the case more rigid and sometimes allows it to be slimmed down while maintaining access to the movement through the back of the watch. At Audemars Piguet, “two-part” wristwatches appeared as early as the 1920s. They are notably found in many Art Deco rectangular watches, several of which are detailed in the book Audemars Piguet’s 20th Century Complicated Wristwatches. In Pre-Model 182 (pictured) introduced in 1982, the bezel blends into the case middle for aesthetic reasons and the back opens on a hinge. Thirty years later, the bezel of Model 5115 seems to be detached from the case middle, but is an integral part of it for water-resistance reasons. Etymologically, monocoque (often translated in English as “monohull” of even “one-piece”) means &quot;a single shell or hull&quot;. Strictly speaking, this implies that the watch is closed, rather like the shell of an egg or a hazelnut, or the hull of a boat. Published in 1998, The Theory of Horology, used to train watchmaking students at Swiss technical schools, provides a definition of monocoque cases: &quot;the bezel, the case band and the back cover are all one.” The consequences are significant for watchmakers at the bench. As the caseback cannot be removed, the movement cannot be accessed from the back and has to be extracted from the dial side. And as there is no bezel, it is the glass that has to be taken off, implying that it must be flexible, made of Plexiglas. On the other hand, the watchmaker must be able to detach the crown before dismantling the movement, so &quot;the winding stem is in two pieces. The first section is part of the movement. The second, on to which the winding button is screwed, is fitted elastically on to the first, once the movement is in place.” By pulling hard on the crown, the watchmaker disengages it from the stem on which it is “snapped”, so that it can be removed. The watchmaking community attributes the term monocoque to the cases of many diving watches, notably by Seiko, Mido, Omega, etc. However, almost all of them have an external rotating bezel. The addition of this bezel should exclude these watches from the monocoque category. It is in fact the definition that should be widened, since in its broadest sense the term means that only the caseback and case middle are merged into a single component. Therefore, according to this extended definition, the structure of the first Royal Oak is indeed similar to monocoque cases, as the caseback and case middle form a single component. The former director of the Audemars Piguet Museum Martin K. Wehrli addressed this issue in a monograph published in 2012 for the Royal Oak’s 40th anniversary. In the chapter entitled &quot;The Monohull Case&quot;, he acknowledges that it only partially meets the definition: &quot;Is it an authentic monohull case? Not really, since the glass is not driven into the case, and the bezel is separate.” We could add that the glass is in in fact a sapphire crystal. Despite these reservations, we will follow the practice of collectors and watchmakers, using the term monocoque here for the Royal Oak cases that merge the case middle and the caseback. The article dedicated to the birth of the Royal Oak goes into detail on Gérald Genta’s sources of inspiration. Inspired by a childhood memory, the designer had applied himself to creating a watch &quot;whose water-resistance had never been done before. I remembered as a child having seen a diver being fitted with a helmet on Geneva’s Pont de la Machine. I was very impressed when I saw the eight bolts and the rubber seal designed to protect a person's life under water. I was tempted to fit a highly prestigious movement inside a case entirely recalling the diver's helmet.” In the above-mentioned article, the reader will find the story of the development of the 100-metre water-resistant Royal Oak case, in collaboration with the Favre-Perret company from La Chaux-de-Fonds. After prototypes were produced in gold, a malleable material, the series-produced cases were made of steel, yet adorned with decorations worthy of noble metals. As a complement to this story, we look here in more detail at the main components of the case: bezel, screws, seal, crown... Let's start with the most complex one, to which the Royal Oak owes its monocoque description: the caseback. The Royal Oak’s monocoque case merges the case middle, caseback and lugs in one component, carved from a single block of steel. Some say it even includes the first two links of the bracelet. From the front, the caseback combines a slightly faceted tonneau shape with a circle. From the back, the circle disappears to make way for a rounded octagon, echoing the bezel, sculpted as if it were a caseback, and which becomes flatter as it nears the bracelet. A side view reveals the full refinement of this extraordinary component. The case middle is slightly curved to match the shape of the wrist and to prepare for the bracelet taper. On the dial side, the effect is highlighted by a progressive bevel leading towards the lugs. A 2012 article in a brochure celebrating the Royal Oak’s 40th anniversary provides details of the steps involved in producing this component of Model 15202: &quot;This means that after the initial blanking operations, the 44 successive turning, milling, trimming and engraving operations must be isolated. All contribute to preparing the monohull case for manual polishing. When the surfaces are pierced in order to house the case and movement fastening screws, and the inscriptions are engraved, it’s time to apply the finishing. The case, sides and lugs are satin-brushed along different axes and in several stages.” In 1972, the machining steps were longer and more complex, as the watch industry had not yet adopted computer-controlled machines (CNC). On the other hand, manual finishing has not changed in 50 years. The Product Sheet for the first Royal Oak, Model 5402, specifies the types of decoration: &quot;Case middle: satin-finished top and sides, horizontal satin-finished edge, polished bevels, circular satin-finished underside, sandblasted retranche [Editor’s Note: non-circular area of the underside]&quot;. It should be noted that the circular graining on the inside of the case middle was only visible when the watchmaker entirely uncased the watch. Martin K. Wehrli liked to point out that this traditional decoration is probably a legacy of non-water-resistant watches, as the interior decoration had to trap micro-dust so that it would not fall into the mechanism. While the Royal Oak’s bezel is often described as octagonal, it is far more than that. Its centre is a circle, while its periphery is a rounded octagon, vertically satin-finished and strongly bevelled. The 40-degree bevel perfectly follows the bezel’s octagonal-rounded shape and results in a thin satin-finished edge. A lapping machine helps create a mirror-polished surface highlighting the traditional technique of bevelling (chamfering). Seen from the front, it takes up almost a quarter of the bezel's surface and links the moiré reflections of the Tapisserie dial to the facets of the tapered bracelet. At each corner of the eight curved facets that punctuate the bezel, a hexagonal hole is made to accommodate a screw. Until then, in the watchmaking tradition, watch bezels had sometimes featured hour-markers, either at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock, or at each hour. In the same tradition, the screws securing cases were always hidden. Gérald Genta departed from these two practices and structured the circumference of the bezel in eight elements independent of the dial since it was impossible to follow the hours graduation. Further freeing himself from the shackles of convention, he punctuated the bezel with visible fastening screws. Note as well that for aesthetic reasons, he decided not to put a screw in the classic 12 o’clock position. In short, Genta designed a bezel driven by its own dynamics and aesthetic rhythms, independent of those on the dial yet echoing the case and bracelet’s design and sensitivity to light. With a maximum thickness of two millimetres, the inside of the Royal Oak “Jumbo” bezel is partially hollowed out to make room for the water-resistance seal. A small undercut is made for the heel of the sapphire crystal to rest on. Water-resistance is ensured when the case is closed and the seals are pressurised. In traditional watchmaking, seals are small rubber elements discreetly placed in the grooves between the three main components of the case, and which disappear from view once the case is assembled. The seal designed by Audemars Piguet for the first Royal Oak is of a different nature. On the one hand, it reveals a thin black line around the edge of the bezel, but above all, its internal measurements are anything but ordinary. With a thickness of 5.59 mm (uncompressed), a width of more than 4 mm, a complex moulded shape combining round and octagonal shapes, punctuated by 9 holes with an almost 2 mm diameter (8 for the through screws and 1 for the winding stem), it is the keystone of the water-resistance system. The seal is squeezed between the bezel, the caseback, a thin casing ring which separates it from the movement and a narrow inner bezel ring (flange) which separates it from the dial. The seal is compressed by the pressure exerted by the eight hexagonal screws that ensure the rigidity of the entire case. This component has of course evolved over time. Various examples of Model 5402 were equipped with two variants: one in black rubber and the other in translucent silicon. The more rigid rubber option (pictured) had a disadvantage in that the material could not be entirely controlled. Certain seals tended to liquify, taking on a honey-like appearance, whereas others diffused gases which damaged the oils of the mechanism... The translucent silicon variant was more stable but also more flexible and it sometimes remained stuck to the case middle and bezel. Some occurrences feature an unsigned seal, but most bear the AUDEMARS PIGUET indication, the SWISS MADE provenance and identification numbers. As we shall see below, later models gave rise to an increasing number of variants, in particular because the quality of the first seals proved difficult to control. The eight hexagonal screws punctuating the octagonal bezel were perhaps the most disruptive element of the 1972 Royal Oak. The advertisers of the 1970s and 1980s were well aware of this, humorously using this non-conformity as an argument for differentiation: “A price like that, he teased, and they don’t conceal the screws?” The slot of the screw heads suggests that they can be turned with a screwdriver, whereas their shape indicates the opposite. Indeed, the fact that they are embedded in the hexagonal openings of the bezel means they are unable to rotate – in other words, these are screws that do not even turn! Some have seen in them the symbol of the case’s resistance, making it a kind of inviolable safe containing a mechanical treasure: Calibre 2121. The secret of this system lies in the fact that the hexagonal screws are fitted with round nuts introduced from the back of the watch and which serve to close it. Nonetheless, although this system protected the movement perfectly, it did not prevent water from seeping down the screws and nuts. Wilfred Berney, founder of the Audemars Piguet Customer Service department, lived through the early years of the Royal Oak. He says that the screws of the first 300 Royal Oak watches were made of steel. Seawater would trickle in along the screws and deposit its salt, &quot;attacking and corroding indiscriminately. The result was appalling and Genta's famous ‘diving helmet’ was blocked... Penetrating oils and other such products could be used to help remove the case screws, but that did not work at all for the bracelet screws. The only way to resolve the situation was to produce special drill bits and a whole set of tools to drill these screws, to reach the part where the bracelet pivots and then make it drop off using ultrasound technology.” These incidents led to Royal Oak screws being made in white gold. Like the caseback and bezel, the crown of the first Royal Oak watches combines different geometric shapes. Its perimeter is a hexagon, which facilitates manual gripping. Its head is highlighted by a circle. The winding stem is structured in two parts, so that the crown can be removed by a strong tug when the watch is dismantled (see the section dedicated to the monocoque case). In any watch, the crown is one of the most vulnerable points because it is directly connected to the fragile watch mechanism. By pulling or turning the crown, the user operates the delicate gear wheels protected by the case. In a watch that is water-resistant to 100m, as the first Royal Oak watches were, the crown was an even more sensitive point, as any handling under water ran the risk of allowing water to penetrate the movement. To guarantee optimal water-resistance, the crown of Model 5402 was partially hollowed out and fitted with two rubber O-rings. The lifespan of these seals varied according to the conditions of use of the watch, its exposure to heat, humidity, etc., but the crown had to be replaced at each service. Since 1972, while remaining true to itself, the Royal Oak has been perpetually renewed. It has been interpreted in more than 550 models. Its diameter has varied from 20 to 44 mm and its thickness from 6.3 to 15 mm. It has been clothed in steel, gold, tantalum, ceramic, titanium and platinum, and even covered in diamonds. It has been fitted with all the classic horological complications, from the perpetual calendar to the chronograph, including the tourbillon, the minute repeater and the Grand Complication. These transformations have been accompanied by countless technical developments. The watch exterior components have been rethought, redesigned and improved countless times. Among those that have changed the least are the eight hexagonal screws. They have always remained through-type screws, with a few exceptions (e.g. the pocket watch variant 5691, certain examples of Models 5554, 25729 or 25860), while the hexagonal upper part has always played the role of a nut, except on rare occasions when they have a simple decorative role (e.g. model 15300). Above all, they have remained in white gold, even if the improvement in the quality of the steel would undoubtedly have made it possible to use this material as had been imagined in 1972.  The crown has also retained its hexagonal shape. Its main aesthetic evolution is due to the addition of an AP engraving, which was introduced at the end of the 1990s and became the norm in the 2000s. On the other hand, the screw-lock crown was adopted in the early 1980s because it reduced the risk of mishandling, particularly when immersed in water. It appeared in 1983 in Models 4332, 5572, 5584, 5658. In 1990, it was added to the 14700 family of models, followed by its direct descendants 15300 (from 2005), 15400 (from 2012), and 15500 (from 2019). In this system, the main seals are fixed to the case, so that they can be replaced independently of the crown. Despite their significant advantages, screw-lock crowns have not been fitted to all Royal Oak watches. They proved to be incompatible with certain calibres (e.g. 2121, 2120, 2835, etc.) and sometimes affected the winding system. This has meant that no ultra-thin Royal Oak 39 mm watches have ever been fitted with them.   Few connoisseurs are aware of the extent to which the interior architecture of the Royal Oak's case has been modified during its history for various reasons – sometimes difficult to pinpoint. These modifications stem from the need to correct defects, but above all from the desire to improve performance and find new technical solutions. Above all, they express the fertile imagination of case construction engineers. The first major change occurred in 1976 and 1977, no doubt at the request of watchmakers. Models 8638 and 4100 gave up the monocoque case and adopted the classic &quot;three-part&quot; structure, enabling easier access to the movement for touch-ups. The water-resistance system was also revised at the same time and the huge black seal was replaced by small flat traditional ones. To fill the space, the bezel was redesigned and extended beneath its visible part: its thickness was increased to 5.3 mm in Model 4100! This system brought rigidity to the case and saved space, thus enabling the Royal Oak 4100 (35 mm) to gain an additional 4 mm in diameter compared to Model 5402 (39 mm), even though it houses a movement that is only 2 mm smaller than the latter. Nevertheless, this change did not solve all the problems. In 1983, Model 4332 (36 mm) returned to the monocoque and revived the oversized seal, of which the quality had been improved. Incidentally, some seals in the 1980s were transparent, e.g. that of Model 14486. In 1990, Model 14700 retained the monocoque structure but significantly reduced the width of the seal, while increasing the width of the casing ring. Two years later, Model 14790 reintroduced proportions close to those of the original. In 1984, another solution was invented. The first Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar, Model 5554, replaced the oversized rubber seal with a very large metal casing ring, independent of the bezel. The idea was quickly abandoned as it jeopardised the watch’s water-resistance (an optimised version of this system was adopted 28 years later on Model 15400). The Customer Service department then created a procedure to correct the 5554 casing rings. At the same time, Audemars Piguet introduced the Royal Oak 5654, aesthetically identical to the 5554, but with a radically different case structure. The solution chosen was different from all the previous ones: the casing ring was the same width as the seal and the screws passed between these two components in half cylinders. It was retained on Model 25636 watches (and their derivatives) from 1993. We could go on and on with the list of case redesigns. We will simply conclude by adding that the &quot;three-part&quot; model became established in the 2000s, having been notably reintroduced in the Royal Oak Grand Complication 25865 in 1997 and in the first Royal Oak Chronograph 25860. Since then, this case has been fitted to the vast majority of models, including the classic Models 15300, 15400 and 15500, as well as the 15202 and the Royal Oak 16202 launched in 2022. This overview of the few transformations of the Royal Oak case sheds light on the complexity of its case and the challenges it has constantly posed. It shows the extent to which an iconic watch – sometimes thought to have remained unchanged and timeless – is in fact the object of constant research. Among the latest innovations, one need only mention the Royal Oak Selfwinding Perpetual Calendar Ultra-Thin 26586 (2019), which uses the dial as an upper movement bridge, or the architectural design of the Royal Oak Minute Repeater 26591 (2021), whose Supersonnerie case amplifies sound by means of a purpose-built “soundboard”.

This practice has an essential objective: to guarantee the long-term authenticity of each watch and enable restoration to its original condition. Mechanical watches are among the very few technical objects that are destined to function for decades or even centuries. Readers will discover the history of the numbering system of Audemars Piguet watches since 1875 in the article dedicated to this subject. To understand the contribution of the Royal Oak to this system, let's start by recalling the practices in force in the early 1970s: - Each movement has a unique number engraved on it, called the &quot;movement number&quot;, which has been assigned consecutively since the 19th century and reached approximately 115,000 in 1970. Only watchmakers have access to it because it can only be seen by opening the case and examining the mechanism on which the number is engraved. - Each watch case also bears a unique engraved number, generally visible on the back of the watch. Assigned consecutively since 1951 (n° 1), the &quot;big case numbers&quot; reached about 60,000 in 1970. After the 100,000 mark in 1975, the series started again at B1 until B99999 (around 1986) then C1 to C99999, etc. In addition, since 1951, each watch has had a model number (or model reference) and contains a mechanism which itself has a calibre number (movement model). Intended for watchmakers or retailers, all these numbers have long remained hidden from watch owners. They only make sense when compared with the corresponding archives and registers. In 1972, the launch of the first Royal Oak raised important questions about the perceived value of these new timepieces. The original plan was to produce 1,000 identical models. This &quot;large-scale&quot; production was unprecedented at Le Brassus and came at a time when Audemars Piguet customers were accustomed to one-off models or series of a few dozen at most. So how could a sense of rarity be maintained with a production of a thousand identical watches? The question was all the trickier in that the Royal Oak was made of steel – a material perceived as cheap – yet its case was so complex that it cost as much as gold. Within this context it is worth recalling that at the time other steel watches such as the Oyster, Seamaster or Speedmaster were often produced by the tens of thousands or even more – and sold for four to five times less. Georges Golay, who was running the company at the time, proposed a simple and brilliant solution. He relegated the &quot;big case number&quot; (see above) to the inside of the watch – as it was of interest to the watchmaker – and in its place had a serial number engraved in large letters on the back of each Royal Oak 5402, starting with number 1 and increasing incrementally. Thanks to this number, the watch owner could be sure that his or her timepiece was unique and that the production of the model was limited. This marked the birth of the &quot;small case number&quot;, also known as the &quot;Royal Oak number&quot;. Since the 1990s, the practice of limited editions has developed in the watch industry based on an almost invariable model: a brand chooses to produce a predefined quantity of identical watches (for example five, 25 or even 500 units) and undertakes to market only the announced quantity. The number engraved on the watch is often a reminder of the edition’s assigned limitation, e.g. X\u002F5, XX\u002F25 or XXX\u002F500. However, the 1972 Royal Oak did not strictly meet this definition and the 1972 Basel Fair press release stated: &quot;In an ultimate touch of refinement, each Royal Oak limited series is numbered.” This sentence is a little masterpiece of semantic acrobatics. On the one hand, the rarity and value of the watches are underlined by the special numbering of &quot;each timepiece&quot;, and the text announces that their number will be limited. On the other hand, it does not indicate any limitation of quantity. Above all, it suggests that several limited series may be produced. If Audemars Piguet had announced in 1972 that it would only be produced in a single 1,000-piece limited edition – as was originally imagined – would the Royal Oak have been able to establish itself in the watchmaking world? Would it have had time to change the perception of steel? Would it have given birth to a collection? No one could predict the success or failure of the Royal Oak, but what is certain is that Georges Golay as an experienced card player kept a few tricks up his sleeve in case things went well. By prefixing the &quot;small number&quot; of the first Royal Oak with the letter A, he kept open the possibility of creating series B, C, etc. Despite its price, its material and its oversized case, the first Royal Oak was an unexpected success. After a little more than a year, almost 1,000 of these watches had been sold, prompting Georges Golay to extend the production run to 2,000 units. Just as with the large case and movement numbers (see the article on this subject), certain numbers were not used, meaning that the A series finally reached 1,937 Royal Oak watches sold between 1972 and 1989. At the end of 1974, the question of the Royal Oak’s future was raised. What should be done with the ‘wild child’? While awaiting a final decision, 129 Royal Oak 5402ST watches were produced and distributed – this time without the &quot;small number&quot; – and 90% of them were sold between January and September 1975. In parallel, Audemars Piguet decided to launch the B series and to use the numbers B1000 to B2000. Sources do not reveal the reasons why the numbers from 1 to 1,000 are not used, but it is probable that Georges Golay wanted the A series to be the only one equipped with numbers lower than 1,000. On March 21, 1975, the first timepiece in the B series left Le Brassus, No. B1044, bound for the tiny island of Guam in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. A total of 845 B-series watches were sold between 1975 and 1993. On December 1, 1976, the first C series Royal Oak emerged from the workshop, followed by 952 others, numbered from C1000 to C2000 and sold until 1987. Then came the D series, with 404 examples distributed between 1977 and 1989. The last variant proved an extremely rare one: between 1988 and 1990, just 21 Royal Oak 5402ST watches with a &quot;small number&quot; (continuing the 5402SA numbers (sic) but without a letter) set the final touch to the numbering history of the first steel Royal Oak. It is tempting for a collector, an auction house or just a curious individual to deduce a sale date from a small case number. Unfortunately, just as with movement numbers and large case numbers, small case numbers do not allow one to date a watch exactly, as the watches were not always distributed in numerical order. For example, the Royal Oak 5402ST A859 was sold two years after the A860. However, with a few exceptions, a study of the registers shows that – for the majority of watches – the small number can at least help define a period (see table). Numbers sometimes carry symbolic value. Thus, when the small numbers on the outside were introduced in the 1900s and beyond, many customers requested the possibility of acquiring watches bearing a number corresponding to a significant year in their lives: date of birth, founding of a company, etc... It is rumoured that the very first Royal Oak 5402ST watches were distributed according to the following principle: the Italian agent Carlo de Marchi was given the even numbers, while the Swiss agent Charles Bauty was given the odd ones. The archives confirm this distribution, while also indicating that it was not systematic and did not exceed the number A100. There are several legends surrounding the Royal Oak 5401ST n°A1. Some say it was delivered to Emmanuel of Savoy, but the archives mention the surname Fradkoff, which most probably corresponds to Serge Fradkoff of Harry Winston. As for the Shah of Iran, the archives show that he acquired the first white gold Royal Oak and that it bore the number 101. Another interesting fact that some collectors have noted is that last three digits of the large case number are often identical to the small number in most of the A, B and C series. A study of the registers confirms this observation. In 1976, when Audemars Piguet introduced the first ladies’ Royal Oak, Model 8638, the question of the numbering system was again raised. While it initially fulfilled its commercial role, the alphanumeric method used for Model 5402ST also revealed its limits. Why start the B series at 1,000? Why make only 500 timepieces in the D series? Up until which letter does the system make sense? Not to mention the confusion between the B in the large number and the B in the small number (see section below). To simplify the system, the letter was dropped. From then on, all new Royal Oak models would carry a small number starting with 1, increasing incrementally for each different material and continuing for as long as the model was produced. Thus, for example, Model 4100 released in 1977 had three No. 1s: one steel, one gold and one two-tone. The new system was also applied to Model 5402 in 1977 when Audemars Piguet decided to add gold variants. On June 8, 1977, the first yellow gold 5402BA – bearing the small number 4 and large number B12753 – was flown from Switzerland to Japan. The BA variation was sold to the tune of 736 units between 1977 and 1990, covering numbers running from 1 to 745. The steel and gold 5402SA variation was produced in a run of 876 units (No. 1 to 951) and the rarest version in white gold used all the numbers in the series, from 1 to 150 – an unusual occurrence. The first cases bearing a large number starting with B were introduced in 1976–1977, almost at the same time as the first Royal Oak B series. This coincidence in the registers may have caused a certain amount of confusion in the world of collectors, as there are &quot;B series&quot; and &quot;B series”, so let’s clarify the situation here. When we talk about a B series of Model 5402ST, we are referring to an original Royal Oak in steel with a small external number engraved beneath the Royal Oak inscription and located between B1000 and B2000. It would be wrong to consider a watch with a large case number (on the inside) starting with a B as a B-series model. For example, Model 5402ST, which belongs to the Audemars Piguet Heritage Collection, bears the small number C1709. Sold in 1979, its large case number is B3709, yet it belongs to the C series. This confusion has sometimes misled collectors of yellow gold models. Most of the 5402BA watches have large case numbers starting with B. However, strictly speaking and according to the standard recognised by the world of museums and collectors, these are not B-series watches. The small numbers of the precious material variants are in fact never accompanied by a letter. Take the example of Royal Oak 5402BA No. 27, sold in June 1977. Despite the fact that its case is engraved (on the inside) with B14661, it is not a B-series model, but in fact 5402BA no. 27 – simply because the letters of the small number had been abolished before the creation of the first Model 5402 in gold. Born in 1972, the small case number – or small Royal Oak number – met a need to enhance the value of the new model. It accompanied an increase in production, resulting in the manufacture of several hundred or even several thousand identical watches. It worked like a limited-series number, but with no maximum limit, based on the principle that the production volumes of Audemars Piguet watches are by definition very small. It also served as a limited-edition number from the 1990s onwards, simply by adding the quantity of the series (e.g. XX\u002F75 for a 75-piece edition). In 1976, the alphanumeric system (reserved for the 5402ST) was abandoned in favour of a simpler numbering system. While perfectly suitable at the time the Royal Oak collection was born, the latter also reached its limits with the multiplication of Royal Oak variations in the 1980s. It became almost impossible to identify them without opening the case to check the large number, thereby forcing the system to evolve once again. Around 1990, the large case number returned to its place on the outside of the watch case, next to the small number. With the advent of open casebacks, the small outer number migrated to the top of the caseback. In the second half of the 2010s, the entire system was thoroughly rethought. The small Royal Oak number vanished and the movement numbers along with the large case numbers became randomly generated and alphanumeric. This system strips the numbers of their temporal or quantitative significance, the aim being to reduce the risk of falsification and copying. It requires the use of sophisticated computer tools to access authentication information, thereby relegating the handwritten registers to their symbolic function and opening a new chapter in the history of Audemars Piguet.

A FEAT OF MECHANICSbackgroundbooksbuildingpapertrainOn April 11, 1970, at 4 pm, Georges Golay, then Audemars Piguet’s Managing Director, phoned Gérald Genta to ask him to draw “an unprecedented steel watch” for the next morning. The designer took inspiration from a childhood memory: the sight of divers, whose lives depended on the water-resistance of their helmets, ready to dive into the Rhône. THE FIRST SKETCHgeraldgroupsignaturewatchgeorgesWhat a crazy idea: an octagonal bezel punctuated by eight hexagonal screws going through the steel case and secured with eight nuts, all the while compressing a gigantic gasket! The case makers were worried about the feasibility of such a watch. They asked if they could first practice on a gold version, a material more malleable than steel. PATENTED INNOVATIONwatchwatchmakerplanpainterbackThe Royal Oak was unveiled on April 15, 1972 at the Basel Fair. This unconventional, iconoclast and revolutionary timepiece shocked some, while appealed to others. It invented the notion of “sport chic” by blending two opposite worlds: Haute Horlogerie and sport. Robust yet hand made, oversize yet ultra-thin, this steel watch cost the price of gold. ICONOCLAST?posterplangroupbaleredpenSmaller but even more radical! Designed by Jacquline Dimier, the very first Royal Oak variation was devoted to women. Proportions were rethought, but the strength of its original codes permeated: straight lines, steel case, integrated bracelet, Tapisserie dial, hand finishes and, of course, a selfwinding movement. FOR WOMENmountainjacquelinecitybikeplanIn 1977, the Royal Oak witnessed the addition of its first gold versions as well as an intermediate size. From then on, the enfant terrible of watchmaking broke free from its steel armour to become a remarkable ground of creative expression. Fifty years later, 550 variations have joined an all-star cast interpreting the original iconoclast that became an icon. FROM ENFANT TERRIBLE TO COLLECTIONdivermountainpyramidwatchThe Royal Oak was designed to play with light. The thousands of pyramids adorning its dial, the facets of its bracelet, the chamfers of its bezel, the alternation of satin-finished and polished surfaces all contribute to making it shine. The first diamonds made their appearance in the collection in 1978, announcing a bright future for the Royal Oak.

The story begins in the small watchmaking town of La Chaux-de-Fonds, situated at an altitude of 1,000 metres, some 100 kilometres from the Vallée de Joux and Le Brassus, where the original modest Audemars Piguet workshop was founded in 1875. At that time, La Chaux-de-Fonds had already opted for industrialisation and the town was nicknamed &quot;the watchmaking metropolis.&quot; The division of labour was so advanced that in his book Capital, the German thinker Karl Marx coined the term “factory town” to describe its archetypal urbanisation. All types of workshops were to be found there, from the most mechanised to artisans having graduated from the city’s art school. At the end of the 1890s, pocket watches adorned with Art Nouveau plant-life motifs were in vogue. They were engraved, guilloché-worked and often enamelled. Miniaturists and engravers struggled to meet the growing demand. It was in this context that Robert-Alfred Lienhard invented the first engraving machine in 1895, the forerunner of the one that would be used for the Royal Oak dials. This highly sophisticated instrument was designed to reproduce all types of decorations on the curved surfaces of pocket watches. Engravers were displeased with the direct competition this machine brought about as it reproduced their skilled moves. This age-old battle between hand and machine forced artisans to constantly reinvent themselves in order to avoid occupying ever-smaller niches. It was however not the engraving machine that inflicted the greatest damage on the engravers of La Chaux-de-Fonds, whose ranks were decimated during the 1920s and 1930s by the arrival of the wristwatch. Unlike pocket watches, whose cases and casebacks provided plenty of scope for ornamentation, the wristwatch had almost no surface available for engraving or enamelled miniature painting. In the absence of objects to engrave, work naturally became scarce for both engravers and machines. The Lienhard company therefore had to reinvent itself, extend its range of tools and seek new markets. With this in mind, it created a simplified engraving machine incising only entirely flat surfaces. It was used to decorate watch dials, but above all novelty jewellery, lighters, cigarette cases, mirrors, etc. This multi-functionality earned it great success in areas outside the watch industry, with many of these machines being exported to the United States and Canada. A few remained in Switzerland and were notably delivered to the Geneva company, La Nationale. In 2019, after many years of research, the great German collector and entrepreneur Helmut Crott, founder of the namesake auction house, published a monograph entitled Le cadran: visage de la montre bracelet au 20e siècle on the most prestigious Geneva-based dial-making firm, Stern Frères. To produce this reference work, he drew upon the recollections of former artisans, notably writing: &quot;Who still remembers, around the 1970s, the LN, aka La Nationale, the Geneva factory next to Stern Frères specialised in the manufacture of metal components such as watch crowns and even lighters? Faced with the sudden death of one of its employees, an excellent guilloché craftsman, the LN wondered whether it would be able to maintain this rare and special form of expertise. It had the idea of turning to the dial maker Stern who agreed to take on a subcontracted order for about 50 dials. The customer was Movado and the dials were those made at the time by the copying machine.” The reader will have noted that the author prefers the term 'copying machine' rather than 'engraving machine'. He continues: &quot;Stern was gifted the seven guilloché copying machines owned by La Nationale and, in the process, inherited the 300 pattern designs that go with them.” In 1970, the design department at Stern was headed by Roland Tille. He realised that the machine had extraordinary potential despite its complexity. It was he who named the technique Tapisserie, later admitting: &quot;I would never have imagined that the moniker I had chosen would establish itself!&quot; Helmut Crott continues: &quot;That same year, Gérald Genta asked Roland Tille for advice on developing a Royal Oak dial. Tille proudly presented the designer with his new engraving machines and the possibilities they afforded. Together, they agreed to produce a few proposals for a Tapisserie decoration. Out of the 13 samples submitted, Audemars Piguet chose the version that to this day is still embedded in its brand DNA.” The author also highlights the &quot;incredible combination of circumstances&quot; that made it possible to revive a craft that was to become &quot;one of the most highly prized techniques in the modern history of dial making.” He notes in passing that the dial of Patek Philippe’s Nautilus was developed on the same machines, following in the footsteps of the Royal Oak. The Tapisserie technique lies at the crossroads of three traditional skills: engraving, guilloché work and pantography. The oldest is engraving, an art born thousands of years ago and used by every civilisation, alongside sculpture and painting. An artisan patiently carves or sculpts the material using tools such as scorpers, burins, chisels and burnishers to depict myths, hunting scenes, characters, flowers, coats of arms and arabesques. Literally anything can be represented by the engraver. In watchmaking, this art appeared as early as the 16th century and was used to decorate table watches, pendants and more. It continues to this day, notably at Audemars Piguet on openworked movements, personalised oscillating weights and dials. The second Tapisserie-related skill is the centuries-old guilloché technique. Suffice it to mention the copying lathe of Tsar Peter I in 1718, as well as the guilloché lathe (also known as a rose engine) made by François Houard for Max Emmanuel of Bavaria in 1712. With these machines, artisans engraved regular straight, curved or wavy lines that were juxtaposed, intertwined or criss-crossed to cover a metal surface with abstract geometrical patterns creating fascinating light effects. From the 18th century onwards, first in France and then Switzerland, the guilloché technique began to be mechanised and notably applied to pocket watch cases. The motifs were &quot;programmed&quot; into cams that rotated in such a way as to create small shifts of position, combining to result in a guilloché pattern. Abraham-Louis Breguet helped popularise this art in the watchmaking field, adorning his creations with hobnail Clous de Paris, barleycorn or basketweave motifs. The third technique is pantography. The Illustrated Professional Dictionary of Horology describes the pantograph as &quot;an instrument for copying drawings mechanically, sometimes also enlarging or reducing them&quot; by means of articulated arms and using a pattern (also called a matrix or model). The Musée International d'Horlogerie in La Chaux-de-Fonds has some superb examples of dials with pantograph script so small as to be barely visible to the naked eye. The pantograph was also used by Vacheron Constantin from the 1840s onwards to produce tiny components so precise that they no longer needed manual touching up and were thus designed to be interchangeable. The Tapisserie pattern therefore combines these three techniques. Like engraving, it hollows out the material with a burin. Like guilloché work, it uses a mechanised lathe. And like pantography, it reproduces the design of a pattern (matrix or model) by modifying its size. Technically, the principle of an engraving machine is simple. Two round metal plates rotate at the same speed. On the first (the pattern, or model), the motifs to be reproduced (Tapisserie) are greatly enlarged. As the plate rotates, a finger (feeler) travels along the relief of the Tapisserie, somewhat like climbing a mountain before descending into the valleys. Thanks to the pantograph system, on the second plate (the dial), a burin hollows out the material to various depths, mechanically reproducing the movements of the feeler, but at a smaller scale. The burin is connected to and governed by the feeler. In other words, when the feeler goes down into a valley, the burin digs deep and when the former travels upwards, the latter digs less and less deeply. The work begins at the periphery of the dial. With each new turn, the burin moves a little closer to the centre until it covers the entire surface. In a Royal Oak dial, it takes 11 turns to cover one millimetre. Helmut Crott explains: &quot;The surface of the dial features slight snail-shaped grooves visible to the naked eye. These lines, created by the burin contribute to the overall aesthetic appeal of the watch. On closer inspection, the base of the raised pattern resembles a granular structure deliberately obtained with the help of a fluted wheel linked to a second feeler that vibrates when the main feeler drops to the bottom of the raised pattern.” These small dots are in fact tiny diamond shapes whose four inner faces reflect the light. As the number of dots is the same for each revolution, they are much tighter in the centre of the dial than at the periphery, creating shimmering moiré effects and drawing intersecting curved lines. Tapisserie is a difficult art. Marc Ferland, head of the guilloché workshop at Audemars Piguet between 2011 and 2021, can talk about it for hours. He knows that setting and adjusting the machines involves numerous parameters and that mastering the tricks of the trade calls for knowledge, instinct, a keen sense of observation and excellent hearing. This is because &quot;the machine sings&quot; and the seasoned artisan can tell by its soft, regular vibration whether the dial will be worthy of his expectations or not. The height of mastery is reached when the guilloché work on an entire dial produces a single strand of metal shaving. “It’s a bit like peeling an apple and keeping the skin in one piece.” Every detail is crucial, right down to the rigidity of the base, which for a long time was made of wood so as to absorb micro-shocks. The base of the machine is now placed on ‘anti-vibration feet’. The article dedicated to the 5402 dial variants goes into detail about the characteristics of the T21 Tapisserie, developed for the first Royal Oak dials and currently known as the Petite Tapisserie. The reader will find information on the truncated pyramids, their variations, the more than 50,000 tiny diamond shapes, the Bleu Nuit, Nuage 50 (Night Blue, Cloud 50) colour, the AP monogram at 6 o'clock and the AUDEMARS PIGUET signature at 12 o'clock, the white gold tritium hands and hour-markers, and more. For almost 30 years, the Petite Tapisserie motif has been found on dozens of types of dial: from the 20 mm mini-Royal Oak to the 44 mm Royal Oak Grande Complication, including the first quartz models, perpetual calendars and gemset versions. Whether attired in shades of blue, slate, black, green, salmon pink or even red, it remains true to itself – meaning always a little different because it is hand-crafted. This pattern is one of the fundamental aesthetic codes of the Royal Oak. However, unlike the eight screws or the octagonal bezel, it is not exclusive. From the end of the 1970s, when the Royal Oak became a collection, many models featured dials without Tapisserie that were sandblasted, brushed or hammered, made of natural stone, mother-of-pearl, sapphire and even entirely paved with diamonds. This diversity enriched the collection and opened up new horizons. As the year 2000 approached, Jacqueline Dimier and the AP design team decided to give the traditional Tapisserie pattern a makeover. The decision was taken at a Product Committee meeting: from the spring of the following year, a new more generous, legible and extensive Tapisserie pattern would be created. The manufacturing technique would remain the same, but the bases of the truncated pyramids would be up to twice as large. As a result, the number of pyramids would be considerably reduced. A Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; dial featured between 680 and 740 pyramids, whereas the new Grande Tapisserie pattern would have only about 380. In 1999, after more than half a century of loyalty to the Basel Fair, Audemars Piguet presented its new models for the first time at the SIHH, the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva, created in 1991. Discreetly, in order to sound out the markets, two new models were adorned with the Grande Tapisserie motif: the Royal Oak Annual Calendar 25920 and the Royal Oak Time for the Trees 15100, issued in a 450-piece limited edition to support sustainable development projects run by the Audemars Piguet Foundation. In addition, Model 14790, regarded at the time as &quot;the classic within the collection&quot;, also featured a Grande Tapisserie iteration. This move proved a great success. In the year 2000, the new Tapisserie pattern was present on most of the Royal Oak collection: 14790, 15000, 5594, 25960, 25730, 25820, etc. Some came in both variations, while others were already available in the new version only. Among them, the brand-new Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; Model 15202 was aimed at purists. While reviving the original codes of 1972, it displayed its movement through a sapphire crystal caseback. But above all, the watch exclusively featured Grande Tapisserie dials, the first of which was immaculately silver-toned. The exhibition press release spoke of a “makeover”. The following year, the Petite Tapisserie pattern vanished from the Royal Oak collection. However, far from having breathed its last, it returned in 2012 to celebrate the Royal Oak’s 40th anniversary on Model 15202. Meanwhile, it had lived on, sheltered by an unexpected host. The Royal Oak Offshore collection was long considered the wild child of Haute Horlogerie. Oversized, excessive and outrageous, it made waves at the time of its birth in 1993. Nonetheless, from 2001 onwards, it perpetuated the tradition of the Petite Tapisserie pattern, which could be found on most of the collection (25721, 25770, 25807, 25854 and 79290). During the following years, while gradually adopting the Grande Tapisserie motif, the Offshore continued to keep the Petite version alive. Some variants of the original Model 25721 were indeed equipped with it at least until 2007. Although loyal to its origins, the Royal Oak Offshore loves freedom. A designer's playground and an ardent fan of innovative materials and bright colours, it introduced, in 2001, a Tapisserie motif even larger than the Grande version on Model 25940SK (with its rubber bezel). While the catalogues initially referred to it as Extra-grande Tapisserie, it became famous under the name Méga Tapisserie adopted in 2005. Meanwhile, it gradually made its way into the Offshore collection, with Model 67450 in 2002, followed by Models 26007, 25986 and 25863 in 2003, then 26020 from 2004, etc... Emblems of extreme sport and sturdiness, the truncated pyramids were larger than ever. They were also non-conformist in two respects: their size and their production technique. Although their shape was derived from the traditional Tapisserie pattern, they are obtained by stamping, using extremely powerful presses. In 2021, an additional, more complex Méga Tapisserie motif saw the light of day with the launch of a new Royal Oak Offshore model (26420) in a 43 mm size: on the dial of Model 26420, the squares were now linked by &quot;mini arms&quot; and the stamping pattern incorporated a vertical snailed motif. It should also be noted that after renouncing it for five years, the Royal Oak Offshore revived the Petite Tapisserie in 2013 (with a 20-piece anniversary 26218 limited edition) and reinstated it within the current collection upon the timepiece’s 25th anniversary, with Model 26237ST. In the year 2000, the Geneva-based dial maker Stern Créations SA was bought up by the Richemont Group, a South African-based holding company notably owning Cartier and Vacheron Constantin and that had just acquired Jaeger-LeCoultre, Audemars Piguet's most important supplier of ébauches. These stunning acquisitions were part of the profound reorganisation of the Swiss watch industry undertaken in the wake of the quartz crisis. Little by little, large holding companies such as LVMH, Swatch Group and Richemont International S.A. were buying up many traditional suppliers of movement blanks, cases, dials and hands. At the same time, the owners of Audemars Piguet – Paulette Piguet and Jasmine Audemars – represented the third and fourth generations on the Board of Directors since the founders. The company was managed by Georges-Henri Meylan, a native of the Vallée de Joux bearing the name of the region's first watchmaker. The corporate culture was strong and backed by a fierce desire to maintain its independence. Guaranteeing this autonomy over the long term meant making choices: Audemars Piguet had to become more vertically integrated. The process began with mechanical movements in the 1990s and 2000s (see the article on the history of Calibre 2120). During the following decade, Audemars Piguet started to learn the dial-making trade. The company began with one of the most difficult skills: the art of Tapisserie. In 2004, Audemars Piguet’s Board of Directors hired Bruno Moutarlier to accelerate the vertical integration of production. Trained as a robot engineer, the determined and charismatic Frenchman began his watchmaking career at Cartier. He was involved in the ascent of the Le Brassus-based brand which expanded between 2000 and 2010 from 350 employees to more than 1,100 and from 16,000 to 28,000 watches produced per year. Upon his arrival, Bruno Moutarlier noticed that Stern Créations was no longer able to meet the growing demand from Audemars Piguet. Deliveries were often late, quality tended to be irregular, returns were increasing, yet the Geneva dial maker had a monopoly on this expertise. Not only did no one else know how to guilloché-work Tapisserie patterns, but the engraving machines were no longer manufactured. Lienhard was absorbed by its competitor Güdel in 1960 and the latter ceased production at the end of the 1970s. As a last resort, Bruno Moutarlier set out in search of second-hand machines. All those in Europe were acquired by the dial makers of the large groups. He found three in the United States that had been used by medal engravers. He purchased them and brought them back to Switzerland, entrusting Jean-Jacques Rochat – a micromechanical genius who founded a small company in the village of Aubonne in 1973 – with the task of understanding the tools and restoring them to their original condition. By a happy coincidence, Jean-Jacques Rochat had just received identical machines for repair... from Stern Créations, from which he was able to derive some precious information. There are times when the stars align perfectly. In 2006, Canadian watchmaker Marc Ferland, who had been working in Audemars Piguet's After-Sales Service department for six years, began training as a guilloché artisan. At the time, this skill was under serious threat, as there were only a handful of such craftsmen left in Switzerland, including 76-year-old Pierre Rosenberg from La Chaux-de-Fonds. For five years, the venerable artisan passed on his knowledge to the young watchmaker in fortnightly sessions, a rhythm interrupted only by a few stays in hospital. During this period, Bruno Moutarlier found other machines in the United States and Canada. He imported them, had them repaired and learned to use them. On many evenings, Audemars Piguet’s Industrial Director donned his working overalls, once again experiencing the smell of oil and blackened hands from ‘tinkering’ with ancient machines. In 2010, the first 300 guilloché Tapisserie dials left the workshops. The colouring, transfers and appliques were still made by Stern. The following year, Marc Ferland took over the workshop and production reached 9,000 dials. Since then, the workshop has continued to grow, welcoming more and more expertise and craftspeople. On June 14, 2014, the Stern Créations company informed Audemars Piguet that it was ceasing its activities, including making guilloché dials. By then, however, Audemars Piguet had achieved complete mastery of Tapisserie patterns. Better still, thanks to the traditional guilloché skills acquired between 2006 and 2011, Marc Ferland had raised the standards of perfection to unprecedented levels. Differences between dials were by then imperceptible to the naked eye, yet the machines were the same and adjusted by hand. In 2022, having scoured the world in the course of a veritable treasure hunt to find all existing antique machines, Audemars Piguet owns 49 of them, all made by Lienhard and his successor Güdel between 1950 and 1976. Thirty-five of them have been restored, improved and are in daily use within the workshop. The others have been carefully preserved to prepare for the future.

The word first appeared in a London slang dictionary in 1823 and denoted “a big, clumsy person, animal or thing.” The term began to enter everyday language in the late 19th century, thanks to the giant elephant named &quot;Jumbo&quot;, whose fame spread across borders and continents. When the aircraft manufacturer Boeing presented its oversized 747 model in 1969, it was immediately nicknamed the &quot;Jumbo Jet&quot; because of its gigantic proportions and the term became increasingly popular from then on. The watch trade press rarely used the term &quot;Jumbo&quot; before 1970, with Europa Star magazine only beginning to use it in 1974. Small, now extinct brands such as Amida, Cattin, Ufo, Nice Time Watch Trading &amp; Co and Ebohr adopted it for their most generous-sized creations. The press did not yet associate this term with the Royal Oak or the Nautilus – now the most famous &quot;Jumbo&quot; watches – upon their release because it was merely an insider nickname at the time. The only occurrence of the term discovered in the Audemars Piguet archives before the 1990s stems from a small publication by Asian distributor Desco, which introduced the Royal Oak in 1973. The &quot;Jumbo Size&quot; expression featured there evoked the exceptional size of an example intended for a sumo wrestler, whose wrist required a 25 cm-long bracelet! Since the early 21st century, the “Jumbo” adjective has become so widespread that it designates any watch deemed to be oversized by the standards of its time. A 1940s watch measuring 36 mm can thus be called “Jumbo” even though it is undersized according to 21st century norms. The same is true of the Royal Oak “Jumbo”: in 1972, 39 mm was an above-average size. In watchmaking, the perception of size is eminently subjective, personal and above all cultural, while also influenced by the state of technology. Let’s take a brief look back at the major stages of this evolution. The history of horology, and more generally that of technology, can be envisioned through the prism of miniaturisation. For example, from the 15th century onwards, some belfry clocks occupied an entire purpose-built tower. As the size of the mechanisms decreased, clocks made their way indoors into castles, palaces and subsequently bourgeois buildings. They were initially affixed to walls, high up so as to leave space for the weights driving the mechanism. Little by little, they shrank to a table clock format. From the 16th century onwards, they could be worn either around the neck, on the belt or in the pocket. By the time the wristwatch became popular in the 1920s and 1930s, the miniaturisation of mechanical movements had reached its ultimate stage. Brass and steel components could not be made any smaller without threatening timepieces’ reliability. As a general rule, each reduction in a movement’s dimensions leads to an exponential decrease in the precision tolerances of its components. The slightest inaccuracy can be fatal to the mechanism. In 1927, Audemars Piguet became a master in this field, creating the world's smallest mechanical movement: Calibre 5\u002F7BF measuring a mere 15.9 mm x 5.8 mm. Having reached their extreme point of miniaturisation, wristwatches then began moving in the opposite direction. Decade after decade, their dimensions became increasingly generous. During the 1920s, the measurements of men's wristwatches were almost always less than 30 mm in diameter across the entire watch industry. It was not until the second half of the 1930s that watches with a diameter of more than 32 mm appeared and only in the 1950s that over 35 mm models began to make their mark. This evolution was notably due to the development of selfwinding watches whose mechanism required more space, as well as to the socio-economic context. The acceleration of activities, travel and lifestyles called for enhanced ergonomics and a larger dial size was required to ensure legibility. In the 1970s, the average size of men's watches was around 35–36 mm, even though the trend for sports watches, particularly diving models, tended to impose more generous measurements. One could mention in this respect the Rolex Daytona (37 mm), the Monaco by TAG Heuer in 1969 (38 mm) and the Memovox Polaris II by Jaeger-LeCoultre in 1970 (41 mm), to name but a few. At 39 mm, the Royal Oak 5402 was the first Audemars Piguet watch produced in series and belonging to the oversized category. Unlike other watches of a similar diameter, it featured a very thin case (with a total thickness of approx. 7.15 mm). It was the contrast between this extreme thinness and its generous diameter that made it the ultimate sport-chic watch. Its Calibre 2121 was then the world's thinnest selfwinding movement driving a date indication (3.05 mm). While it is probable that Gérald Genta wanted to give the Royal Oak an imposing diameter, his later testimonies do not mention this desire. It was the relatively large diameter of the movement (28 mm), coupled with the unusual case construction, that imposed such measurements. The eight hexagonal screws punctuating the bezel were driven through the whole monocoque case and the oversized seal. Since it would have been impossible to make them pass through the mechanical movement, watchmakers placed them on the periphery of the latter. As a result, size was born of function. From the second half of the 1970s, the Royal Oak became a collection. In response to market demand, Audemars Piguet created smaller versions. The women’s Model 8638 designed by Jacqueline Dimier in 1976 measured just 29 mm in diameter. From 1980, it was followed by numerous other feminine models with a diameter of 30 mm (6008, 4587, 14470, etc.) and even 26 mm (6010, 6012, 6007, etc.). This miniaturisation reached its limits in 1997 with the Mini Royal Oak family, featuring a diameter of 20 mm (67075, 67076, 67287, etc.), notably created for the Japanese market. The men's models were also shrinking. Introduced in 1977, the Royal Oak 4100 measured 35 mm in diameter and set a new standard. For six years, all the new mechanical men's models (4120, 4153, 4331) featured this diameter, as did some quartz models (6023, 6036, 6037, etc.). The lines shifted slightly in 1983 and from then on, the 35 mm size continued to appear in only a few rare models (14544 in 1987; 14486, 14567, 14575, 14674 in 1990), whereas the new 36 mm standard prevailed for two decades. The wild child had mellowed. The Royal Oak was no longer oversized or exclusively in steel, but also available in gold, in gemset versions, etc. Equipped with Calibre 2125, Model 4332 introduced in 1983 heralded the line of 36 mm Royal Oak watches. That same year, the range was enriched with calendar functions (Day Date, 5572, 5581, 5584; moon phases 5658, 5595). This was followed by &quot;three-hand&quot; models, including Model 14498 (1986), the Royal Oak 14700 (1990) as well as its derivatives 14701, 14702 and 14704 released two years later. The year 1992 saw the birth of Model 14790, which remained the central model in the Royal Oak collection for over a decade. This evolution explains why the term “Jumbo” remained associated with the original Model 5402. It is even likely that this nickname became established during the 1980s and 1990s. When referring at the time to the first Royal Oak, adding the epithet “Jumbo” ensured a contrast with the 36 mm models dominating the market. For three decades, the only 39 mm Royal Oak models were those with a perpetual calendar, simply because Calibre 2120\u002F2800 featured the same base movement as the original model from 1972. In such cases, the diameter of the watch is dependent on that of the mechanism it houses. At the end of the 1990s, the trend was towards imposing, assertive, uninhibited objects. In the automotive field, for example, the Hummer 4x4s launched in 1992 paved the way for the SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle) age. In the watchmaking field, it was the testosterone-laden Royal Oak Offshore 25721, 42 mm that kicked off the oversized era in 1993. The average size of watches until then had been around 35–36 mm. Given that the 39 mm Royal Oak 5402 had already been nicknamed &quot;Jumbo&quot;, how would one describe a 42 mm watch? When he first saw it at the Basel Fair, Gérald Genta forcefully expressed his sense of betrayal, dubbing it a &quot;sea elephant&quot;. Collectors opted to call it &quot;The Beast&quot;. The success was as unexpected as it was spectacular and the Royal Oak Offshore swept the entire industry in its wake. Within a decade, the average diameter of the watches exploded, exceeding 40 mm and in some instances 50 mm! The classic Royal Oak was part of this trend. In 2005, the flagship model of the 15300 collection (Calibre 3120, centre seconds) replaced Model 14790. By then, the standard diameter was 39 mm. Seven years later, at 41 mm, Model 15400 went even further. In 2019, Model 15500 (equipped with Calibre 4302) succeeded it and confirmed this dimension. Since the beginning of the third millennium, the Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; has clearly no longer been oversized, despite its now inseparable nickname. For now, back to the 1990s. During its first 20 years, the Royal Oak (excluding perpetual calendar versions) came in just one 39 mm version, 95% of which were sold before 1982. It was not until 1992 that the &quot;Jumbo&quot; version was revived to mark the 20th anniversary of the Royal Oak. By then, the Royal Oak had become a watchmaking icon and an essential collection for Audemars Piguet, which offered around 20 models in a wide range of variations. An anniversary often provides an opportunity for a return to roots. Issued in a 1,000-piece limited edition, the Jubilee 14802 paid tribute to Model 5402. In all, 691 examples were produced in steel, 286 in yellow gold, along with 20 in platinum from 1995 onwards. Model 14802 introduced the first salmon pink dials as well as hammered &quot;Tuscany blue&quot; iterations, although there is no record of how many of these special dials were produced. In addition, a sapphire caseback revealed Calibre 2121 and most of the latter’s gold oscillating weights featured an anniversary motif accompanied by the case number. From 1992 to 2000, several &quot;Jumbo&quot; models equipped with ultra-thin Calibre 2120 were introduced in very small series, without date, almost always openworked and often gemset. The first of these variants was the Royal Oak 14811 in 1992. This one-of-a-kind model was auctioned to support the newly created Audemars Piguet Foundation, which has since been contributing to the cause of worldwide forest conservation through environmental protection and youth awareness-raising programmes. The watch features a royal oak tree depicted by a modelled engraving. Later, the finely chased oak motif adorned at least three models: 15075 (around 1995), 12517 and 12530 (one-of-a-kind anniversary pieces in 2000). While the Royal Oak 14789, 14793 and 14814 housed an openworked calibre graced with gemset hands, Models 14884 and 12518 (a unique 125th anniversary creation) featured a naval anchor against a background of stormy waves surrounded by ropes, in tune with the collection’s name inspired by the Royal Oak English naval vessels. The archives reveal that as early as 1991, technical plans were ready to relaunch a non-limited Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; in the current collection, with a solid caseback. However, Steve Urquhart and Georges-Henri Meylan, who were co-directors of Audemars Piguet at the time, put the project on hold until the 1,000 examples of Model 14802 were sold out. That took four years, compared with the less than two years required to distribute the first 1,000 Royal Oak 5402 watches 20 years earlier. In 1996, Audemars Piguet had a stock of 350 Calibre 2121 ébauches and the time had come to case them up. Model 15002 was finally launched in 1996. Its production was limited however, as out of the 14,000 watches planned for that year, only 70 were Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; watches! The following years confirmed these extremely modest proportions. In three years, 174 of these timepieces were produced in steel and 12 in yellow gold. From aesthetic and technical standpoints, Model 15002 was the one most closely resembling the 5402 from 1972 – so much so that many components were interchangeable with the latter. The architecture of the exterior showed little change: a monocoque case with a solid caseback, a Tapisserie dial, a tapered bracelet and an oversized seal. Only the angle of the bevelled bezel was slightly modified to reach 45 degrees, compared with 40 degrees for Models 5402, 14802 and future 15202. It is also worth noting the monogram AP at 12 o’clock and the AUDEMARS PIGUET signature featuring slightly more generous dimensions than in 1972. Although respectable, this utmost fidelity to the origins of the watch had reached its limits. In order to enter the third millennium in due style, the Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; had to be renewed – and that is exactly what Model 15202 would accomplish. On June 6, 1999, the Audemars Piguet Product Committee expressed concern that Model 15002 was no longer available. Some suggested that production should be relaunched. Despite the 186 of these watches sold, the stock of 350 Calibre 2121 ébauches had not decreased for three years, while the extremely modest orders placed with Jaeger-LeCoultre had sparked rumours that the manufacturer in Le Sentier was going to cease production of this mechanical marvel. To save this precious heritage, Audemars Piguet began examining two avenues. One was a medium-term attempt to internalise this production (see the Calibre 2120 story); and the other a short-term bid to revitalise the Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot;, the spearhead model driven by Calibre 2121 since 1972. Two weeks later, the Committee decided to replace the 15002 with a new reference, the Royal Oak 15202 which, in addition to evolving the design of the collection, also heightened its ambitions: 300 of these timepieces were scheduled for production in 2000, 250 of which in steel and 50 in yellow gold. The Royal Oak 15202 was presented on March 30, 2000 at the SIHH (Salon Internationale de la Haute Horlogerie). It interpreted the original 5402 codes much more freely than the 14802 and 15002. For the first time, the Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; sported a silver-toned dial, available for both the steel and yellow gold variants. The 15202ST version also remained available in &quot;dark blue&quot; and &quot;cosmos blue&quot;. In 2006, a pink gold (OR) variant was added, also with a silver-toned dial. In addition, all these dials featured a guilloché Grande Tapisserie pattern. The monocoque case, whose water-resistance had shifted to 50 m, retained the same proportions, while its sapphire caseback highlighted the mechanism’s beauty. The Royal Oak 15202 was steadily forging its path. In parallel, a number of &quot;Jumbo&quot; models in limited series were created, including the Royal Oak 15128 in 2003 for Italy; the 15201 edition celebrating the 10th anniversary of the pioneering watch collectors' website &quot;The Purist&quot; in 2011; and the 15205 created for the Hong Kong Hour Glass boutique in 2015. From the Royal Oak’s 40th anniversary in 2012 onwards, Model 15202 set the watchmaking world on fire. An anniversary book by Martin K. Wehrli and Heinz Heimann was published and a major retrospective exhibition toured the world. But above all, the 15202OR (pink gold) and ST (stainless steel) were equipped with dials faithful to the 1972 series A, with the AP monogram at 6 o'clock, Petite Tapisserie motif and Bleu Nuit, Nuage 50 colour. A modernised openworked variant was introduced, with pure lines and blackened bridges: Model 15203 initially issued in a 40-piece platinum limited edition, followed by a pink gold iteration. The yellow gold Royal Oak 15202 disappeared temporarily – to return in 2017 with blue and gold-toned Petite Tapisserie dials. In 2014, the 15202 Grande Tapisserie variants disappeared from the catalogue. More importantly, the 15202 became the only 39 mm model in the collection (along with its derivative 15205), as the Royal Oak 15300 (39 mm, Calibre 3120) was replaced by the 15400 (41 mm) in 2012 and the Royal Oak Perpetual Calendars also shifted up to 41 mm in 2015 (Calibre 5134). After several decades of discretion, the Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; enjoyed renewed popularity by combining tradition and modernity. Demand rocketed. In response, workshops grew and watchmakers were trained in the secrets of ultra-thin Calibre 2121, which had been made in-house since the 2000s. Efforts were focused on increasing production. Having started with an annual production of a few dozen, Audemars Piguet managed to deliver more than 1,000 of these timepieces from the mid-2010s. At the same time, the market for old Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; watches was growing rapidly and enthusiasm was the order of the day. 2018 marked the revival of bimetallic variants, which had been absent since the 1970s. This time, titanium was combined with platinum in the Royal Oak 15202IP, featuring a gradient-effect smoked blue dial. Three years later, in 2021, platinum made a comeback (after the 20 examples of Model 14802) in a variant with a smooth smoked green sunburst dial. It was in April of that same year that François-Henry Bennahmias – at the helm of Audemars Piguet since 2012 – made headlines by announcing the end of Model 15202. A very last version was created for the Only Watch charity auction, with a case in beadblasted titanium and a polished bezel in metallic glass – a palladium-based alloy representing a first for AP. On November 6th, 2021, this Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; was sold for CHF 3 100 000.-. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of its icon, Audemars Piguet is introducing seven new calibres into the collection and evolving the aesthetics of many models. All 72 references in production are fitted with a &quot;50 years&quot; oscillating weight! The collection is also witnessing the replacement of Model 15202 by a new Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; reference. Model 16202 complies with the original 5402 aesthetic codes to the letter. The major change is to be found inside, where Calibre 7121 replaces the legendary 2121. A little larger than its predecessor (29.6 mm rather than 28 mm in diameter), its 3.2mm thickness remains faithful to the original. Developed and produced by Audemars Piguet engineers and watchmakers, its performance benefits from the latest technical advances. Its barrel, for example, stores nearly three times more energy within the same volume. This makes it possible to increase the frequency of the balance (28,800 vph compared with 19,800 vph), which improves reliability and precision, while increasing its power reserve (55 hours as against 40 hours). In addition, a fast date-setting system has been introduced. In 2022, Model 16202 comes in four steel, pink gold, yellow gold and platinum variants. While the stainless steel version hews as closely as possible to the original design codes with its Petite Tapisserie in Bleu Nuit, Nuage 50 shade, the pink and yellow gold versions respectively adorn a smoked Petite Tapisserie in grey or yellow gold-toned hues. For its part, the platinum version presents a deep smoked green sunburst dial evoking the colour of the spruce trees in the Vallée de Joux. In addition, two versions in steel and pink gold (Models 16204) are equipped with an entirely new openworked mechanism measuring a mere 2.7 mm in thickness, Calibre 7124, with no date indication. Some collectors have adopted the term “Jumbo” to describe all ultra-thin 39 mm Royal Oak watches. This includes the perpetual calendar variants, equipped with Calibres 2120\u002F2800, created between 1984 and 2015. From 2022 onwards, they can add the 26670 selfwinding flying tourbillon model, whose revolutionary Calibre 2968 architecture is just 3.4 mm thick! Since June 2020, a full showcase pays tribute to the Royal Oak “Jumbo” at the Musée Atelier Audemars Piguet in Le Brassus, with nine variations displayed. These timepieces narrate 50 years of history and radiate around one example of Model 5402, A26 series.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, timepieces’ role as jewellery was often given priority over displaying the time – so much so that their dials were frequently hidden beneath a gemset cover. During that period, they tended to be referred to in French as bracelets-montres (watch bracelets) rather than montres-bracelets (wristwatches). This tradition continued in the 20th century despite the considerable improvements in the accuracy of miniature movements – and particularly so at Audemars Piguet through watches with very elaborate bracelets, often gemset and almost always in gold or platinum, crafted by the best jewellery artisans. The history of men's wristwatches is different. It was not until the 20th century that men gradually adopted the idea of wearing a watch on their wrist. The experience of trench warfare in World War I helped them understand that being able to check the time by glancing at a wrist-worn timepiece was far more efficient than resorting to pocket watches when it came to synchronising military operations. However, contrary to the tendency with ladies’ watches, the timekeeping function took precedence over all others. This is probably why men adopted leather straps on both inexpensive and luxury watches, which doubtless contributed to ensuring that these models stood out from women's timepieces. For several decades and with only a few exceptions (e.g. Pre-Model 1530), men's wristwatches at Audemars Piguet were fitted with calfskin, pigskin, suede and even tapir leather straps. Despite being both flexible and ergonomic, leather straps are not resistant to sports activities, especially aquatic ones. What is the point of a watch with a water-resistant case if its strap cannot withstand water? To make men's sports watches sturdier, certain brands such as Rolex, Omega and Breitling popularised steel bracelets in the 1940s and 1950s. At Audemars Piguet, the 1960s ushered in the first golden age of watches with metal bracelets for both men and women. These gold or platinum bracelets were adjusted, finished and attached to their cases in the workshops of Le Brassus, having first been crafted by the best independent chainmakers and jewellers. These included Italian firms such as Masella, Antonioli, Guiseppe Villa, Ponti, Hafner and Galanti; Parisian companies like Cristofol and Georges Lenfant; as well as Geneva-based artisans such as Jean-Pierre Ecoffey, renowned for his bracelets produced for Patek Philippe. These were braided and woven into Milanese, Polish and sometimes even double-Polish mesh patterns. Some were engraved, composed of tiles or triangles, in some cases combining asymmetrical elements and sculpting surfaces graced with a wealth of depth effects. These bracelets spoke the language of craftsmanship and struck a pleasing contrast with the steel bracelets of sports watches such as the Oyster by Rolex and the Constellation by Omega – a company that patented an integrated bracelet as early as 1964 (CH405170). The two worlds nonetheless merged under the impetus of Audemars Piguet's general agents in Italy, France and Switzerland. In this respect, the Royal Oak bracelet embodied a seemingly absurd paradox: combining steel with hand finishing and sport with the refinement of jewellery bracelets. In an interview granted to Audemars Piguet in 2011, designer Gérald Genta recalled the importance of the bracelet as an identifying factor for a watch: &quot;Seeing just a few centimetres or even a few millimetres is enough to get the picture and you don’t need to see everything, which confirms how important it is!” He added that as far as the Royal Oak was concerned &quot;The whole point was to make a steel selfwinding watch equipped with an expensive movement. The bracelet had to be extremely flat, thin, supple and aesthetically pleasing, playing with light thanks to the flat satin finish. When you see the watch on your wrist, the light sings on the bracelet!&quot; The design of the Royal Oak bracelet was inextricably bound up with that of the case. Genta said that its shape came about naturally: &quot;It was entirely logical when viewed from the drawing board!” The article devoted to the birth of the Royal Oak 5402 deals with the creation of the Royal Oak bracelet by Geneva-based firm Gay Frères. Here, we will examine its major technical characteristics such as the studs, screws, attachments, folding clasp, as well as its main evolutions. One commonly accepted fact about the Royal Oak is that it has an “integrated bracelet”. But what does that involve? And what exactly is the meaning of this term, which is not clearly defined in watchmaking literature? Whereas the manual titled The Theory of Horology published in 1998 does not use this term, it describes a similar concept under the category of “bracelets hard-soldered to the case”. This means that the case and bracelet are immovable, interlocking and designed as a single entity. They certainly correspond to the definition of an &quot;integrated bracelet&quot;. Many Audemars Piguet ladies’ watches from the 1960s–1990s were fitted with bracelets belonging to this category. One of the most significant was Model 5403, introduced in 1971. Its designer Gérald Genta described it as &quot;magnificent&quot; and was delighted with its &quot;perfect integration&quot;: the bracelet composed of ten very thick Polish-mesh links gradually widened to embrace the dial. The tradition of soldered (or integrated) bracelets continued until the 1990s. Jeweller Ywan Kunzle remembers that when he first joined Audemars Piguet in 1989, adjusting bracelets and attaching them to their cases by brazing represented the main task of five to seven craftspeople. That is however not the way the Royal Oak is built and a watchmaker can easily separate the bracelet from the case by means of four lateral screws. So why did Gérald Genta – along with a large proportion of the watchmaking community – refer to this bracelet as “integrated”? The answer lies in the geometry of the watch. From a strictly aesthetic standpoint, the first bracelet link is an integral part of the case, with two studs attached to the bevelled part of the case middle and connecting it to the first mobile link of the bracelet. While some may dispute this interpretation – including watchmakers who may claim that “a case is a case!” – it provides a vivid reminder of the Royal Oak’s ability to blur the boundaries between conventional categories. The Royal Oak bracelet is composed of large tapering links connected by pairs of small rectangular studs. The bracelet fitted to the first Royal Oak, Model 5402, bears no. 344. The widest link is attached to the case middle and measures 25.9 mm, while the narrowest link measures a mere 15.9 mm, corresponding to the width of the folding clasp to which it is attached. The difference in width between the two attachment links is significant, with one almost double that of the other. The magic lies in the fact that these two sizes are connected by a flowing, perfectly designed line: the famous bracelet taper. To be sure of this, a watchmaker (or collector) must be able to run their finger along the entire length of the bracelet sides in one seamlessly smooth move – a test that can also be performed on the top of the bracelet, where all the elements must be flush. To create this continuity effect, bracelet no. 344 is composed of 17 to 20 links (depending on its length), produced in 12 different sizes. Visually, the &quot;decrescendo&quot; effect might have been reduced if the studs connecting the links had been aligned and of identical size. A trained eye will discover that this is not the case. As the bracelet narrows, the width of the links slowly decreases from 3.6 mm to 2 mm. To maintain harmonious proportions, the distance between the studs also gradually decreases from 8.9 mm to 7.1 mm. The studs follow the outer curve of the bracelet. To achieve this, they are produced in nine different sizes for each bracelet strand! Back in 1972, this was a world-first feature for an integrated steel bracelet. Gérald Genta was not mistaken when he said that the tapering bracelet involved &quot;a highly complex production process&quot;. Bracelet no. 344 (with extension links) has 154 components, including 20 links, 44 studs, 75 pins and 8 screws (including the screws for securing it to the case middle). In all, it consists of 34 variously shaped elements that are adjusted, decorated and assembled by hand. Each stud is secured by two grooved pins, &quot;hard-driven&quot; into the link, then gently filed so that their heads disappear into the side of the bracelet. These pins are the keystone of the bracelet's flexibility, which must be &quot;neither too soft nor too stiff&quot;. They are subject to constant friction and wear out over time, which explains why some 1970s bracelets have become very supple 50 years later. In addition to the pins, the top and bottom edges of the links and studs are slightly rounded to accommodate their rotational movements, giving them a certain suppleness. The surfaces of the bracelet are finely satin-finished, with the same grain as those of the case middle and bezel, so as to reflect the light smoothly and create an effect of continuity that reinforces the impression of an &quot;integrated bracelet&quot;. The lateral edges are bevelled and worked on with a lapping machine or grinding wheel in such a way that the light bounces off them as brightly as the movement's bevelled steel parts. They continue along the ridges of the case, while the facets separating the links are sandblasted to accentuate the gleam of the other components. To ensure an even more seamless taper, the bevels on the first link pick up the lateral bevels on the case middle. However, the closer the links are to the buckle or clasp, the narrower the bevels. Creating these “degressive bevels”, a procedure done by hand once the bracelet is assembled, is a tricky operation. These refined details explain why – despite its original masculinity based on its visible screws, its oversized steel case and its taut lines – the Royal Oak had always been in touch with its feminine side since 1972 and could thus be interpreted as early as 1976 in a women’s version (see the article on the birth of the first women’s model). Although Model 5402 shattered all Audemars Piguet records in terms of quantity, with more than 6,000 units produced in a decade, the Royal Oak was a quintessentially hand-crafted watch at the time of its birth. Watchmaker Fredy Capt, who assembled the first Royal Oak watches in 1972, recalls that &quot;the bracelet makers and case makers were not accurate enough.” Watchmakers had to adjust each bracelet using a file: &quot;Each one was customised to fit the case and was thus not suitable for any other model.” This meant that when the watches were returned to Customer Service for servicing or repair, the watchmakers who dismantled them would often discreetly engrave the last two case numbers on both the bracelet and the bezel, so as to ensure that they were correctly matched when they returned from the refurbishment workshops. Bracelet no. 344 from the first Royal Oak has undergone several evolutions, punctuating a steady process of continuous improvement. The Royal Oak’s early years witnessed three distinct evolutions of the attachment between the bracelet and the case middle. In its first version, the screw was placed at the outer end of the case middle and at the inner end of the studs (see &quot;Version no. 1” diagram). This position soon proved to be problematic, as the watch owner could easily rotate the studs through a 90-degree angle, thereby jeopardising the aesthetic flow of the bracelet. To remedy the situation, the Customer Service department welded small plates under the first link (also shown on the “Version no. 1” diagram) so that the latter could no longer rotate as much. This solution was applied for several years on watches returned to Le Brassus for servicing. In parallel, the Technical department modified the position of the screws on the studs and on the case (&quot;Version no. 2&quot;). The plans indicate that the latter variant was implemented in August 1974, which corresponds to the last examples of the A series. It is however possible that the modification was applied gradually. The folding clasp is a bracelet-securing device, first patented in 1909 by the Jaeger company in Paris, which prevents the watch from slipping off the wrist if the bracelet is inadvertently opened. This type of clasp became widely used in sports watches – especially those with steel bracelets – after World War II. The blades were usually closed by a large cap pierced with holes on the sides to adjust the length. However, Audemars Piguet introduced the folding clasp at a later date. Although gold and platinum bracelets were common from the 1960s onwards, they were most often fitted with traditional jewellery-watch fastening systems. The Royal Oak’s sporty vocation made it the first Audemars Piguet watch to feature a folding clasp. While its function is essential, its design is all about ensuring it merges into the background. When the watch is on the wrist, the two blades are so well hidden under the bracelet that it is almost impossible to know they are there. A small cap spanning the width of a link swings open to secure the bracelet, as well as to conceal and strengthen its attachment system. This discretion is one of the signature codes of the Royal Oak bracelet. Although the shape and number of blades of the folding clasps have undergone numerous variations since 1972 (double blade, triple blade, cut-out blades, others bearing the AP monogram, etc.), Audemars Piguet has always kept them hidden beneath the bracelet links in order to highlight the latter. Collectors are aware that the first blades of bracelet no. 344 bear the design of a chamois head framed by the letters G and F, the trademark of the famous Geneva manufacturer Gay Frères. To the right of this signature are indications of the material (&quot;STAINLESS STEEL&quot;) and origin (&quot;SWISS MADE&quot;), as well as the batch and production year (1 – 72 in the first example shown here). To the left of the signature sits the &quot;PATENTED&quot; inscription. It is however difficult to be sure which patent number is being referred to, given that the double-blade system with a small cap does not appear in a Gay Frères patent until much later, in 1979 (patent CH63697). Note that the mention &quot;PATENT&quot; vanished in the mid-1970s, before reappearing in the early 1980s. It is impossible to ascertain from existing sources just how many examples of the Royal Oak 5402 were equipped with Gay Frères blades. This inscription was replaced by an Audemars Piguet signature in 1975 or even earlier, probably at the request of other suppliers who also wished to sign their part... It is worth recalling that maker’s marks were applied to the gold cases, and that Stern engraved its star on the back of the Royal Oak dials. It is rare to find other signatures, except for those of retailers such as Bulgari, Tiffany or Gübelin which sometimes appear on the dials. Another interesting detail for collectors: in 1977, the first examples of Model 5402BA were equipped with yellow gold blades. However, as this material quickly proved to be too soft, the following models were equipped with stiffer white gold blades. In addition to hiding the blade-locking system, the small cap plays a safety role. So as to keep it closed, two small catches slot into grooves located where the link pins are. This means that the blades cannot open so long as the cap remains closed. The caps of Model 5402 have also evolved. Originally, the first ones were engraved with the name AUDEMARS PIGUET spelled out in full before being replaced a few years later by the AP monogram. The archives do not reveal the date of this change, but the watchmakers in the Customer Service department agree that the caps with the full name were gradually abandoned during the period when the 5402 series B was marketed, i.e. between 1975 and 1976. After Model 5402, bracelet no. 344 was used on several Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; models, in particular the 4187 (1979), as well as the first ultra-thin Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar, Model 5554 (1984) and its subsequent versions such as the 25624 (1985), 25654 (1986), 25636 (1986) and others. In 1981, this bracelet underwent a final evolution: at the request of the markets and Customer Service, Audemars Piguet proposed a smaller variant with a folding clasp for slender wrists and introduced &quot;half-links&quot; with welded studs to ensure finer length adjustments. These two improvements were rarely used because the system was particularly fragile. It was replaced by the &quot;link and a half&quot; in subsequent generations (a link that was 50% larger, thus enabling easier adjustment of bracelet sizes). Towards the end of the 1980s, bracelet no. 344 manufactured by Gay Frères was replaced by no. 944, produced by the Werthanor company in the small watchmaking town of Le Locle. A new closing system was introduced, consisting of a sliding stud that replaced the cap. Bracelet no. 944 was very similar in size to its predecessor, meaning that certain Royal Oak models with a Perpetual Calendar, such as the above-mentioned Models 25654 or 25636, as well as 25686 (1989), 25687 (1989) and 25694 (1990), were successively equipped with bracelet no. 344, then no. 944. Just as the AP monogram migrated from 6 o'clock to 12 o'clock on the 5402 dial, the transition was gradual and probably took several years. Nevertheless, some models were exclusively equipped with bracelet no. 944 right from the time of their creation. This was notably the case for the Royal Oak &quot;Jumbo&quot; Jubilee Edition 14802 (1992). The same went for its successor 15002 (1996), for the 15202 model from the year 2000 onwards and its 15201 variants (2011). In 2012, a new generation of bracelets appeared on the occasion of the collection’s 40th anniversary. The 15202 was equipped from then onwards with the bracelet no. 1240, as were its successors, such as the 15205 (2015). Notably produced by Maspoli in Villeneuve, its ergonomic system involving a double folding clasp opening by means of two opposing pushers has equipped timepieces including Model 15300 since 2005 (bracelet 1220, Werthanor). Given that bracelets nos. 344 and 944 could easily be substituted for one another (with the necessary manual adjustments), the Customer Service department has sometimes replaced badly damaged bracelets no. 344 with 944s. This practice evolved in 2020 thanks to the Classic Parts programme, serving to reconstitute bracelets as closely as possible to the original 344. While respecting its original shape, the Royal Oak bracelet has evolved as the collection has grown, leading to combinations of materials, gemset versions and above all changes in size. A new 29 mm diameter was created in 1976, followed by 35 mm versions the following year, then 26 mm and 30 mm in 1980, 36 mm in 1983, 33 mm in 1984, 40 mm in 1997, 37 mm and 41 mm in 2012, 38 mm in 2019 and 34 mm in 2020. These variations have been accompanied by the creation of new bracelets. As early as 1976, the Gay Frères bracelet no. 424 was introduced to equip the small women’s models including the 29 mm 8638 and 6009, as well as the 30 mm 6008, 6013, 6020, 6033 and 6035. Produced in a run of more than 10,000 units, bracelet no. 477 (and its successor no. 789) is one of the most important in the Royal Oak’s history. As early as 1977, it was fitted to 35 mm timepieces: 4100, 4120, 4153, 4275, 4331, 6023, 6036, 6037, 6038, 6039, 6040, 14486. From 1983, it found its place on the Royal Oak 36 mm: 4332, 5572, 5581, 5584, 5658, 5595, 56123, 56124, 5594, etc. As of 1985, 33 mm variants such as the Royal Oak 56255 were also equipped with this bracelet, before it was replaced in the 1990s by no. 789 (by Gay Frères and later by GTF), featuring a size and mode of operation comparable to those of its predecessor. Bracelet no. 789 was also used for the 14700 line, including the 14790 (36 mm), as well as for the small 15000 (33 mm) or the 25800 Model (33 mm). It should also be noted that bracelet no. 789 introduced mirror-polished studs, featuring a subtle aesthetic requiring manual work on no less than 125 angles per bracelet! This tedious enumeration highlights the little-known yet surprising fact that Audemars Piguet has equipped watches of different diameters (33 mm, 35 mm and 36 mm) with the same bracelet. Why and how can components of such different dimensions be adjusted? This practice is explained by the bracelet’s extreme complexity. For watchmakers in the 1980s and 1990s, it seemed more judicious to adjust the taper of the case lugs rather than the width of the bracelet. For the historian and collector, this demonstrates the astonishing reality that the case shape was designed for the bracelet and not the other way around! In the late 1970s and 1980s, in response to the Royal Oak’s growing success, Audemars Piguet decided to expand its supply of bracelets. The co-founder’s grandson, Jacques-Louis Audemars, turned to the workshops of the Lascor company, located in the small town of Sesto Calende, on the Italian side of Lake Maggiore. Founded in 1921, Lascor was run by its founder Pietro Fontana and his son Fernando. Like Audemars Piguet, it was a family business devoted to ancestral know-how. Fernando Fontana had moreover created another eponymous company which had been manufacturing the case of the Royal Oak 8638 since 1976. From 1980 onwards, Lascor manufactured bracelet no. 516 for the miniature Royal Oak versions (26 mm), followed by Models 6007, 6010, 6012, 6019, 6027, etc. This was followed by the even smaller bracelet no. 677 and the 696 for the 33 mm Royal Oak (e.g. Model 56143). There was an increasing number of gemset variants from 1985 onwards, notably with Model 56199 (33 mm, bracelet no. 715 entirely paved with brilliant-cut diamonds), bracelet no. 593 (set with sapphires and diamonds) as well as nos. 726, 727, 821, etc. In 1986, Lascor was renamed GTF. Little by little, it became the main producer of Royal Oak bracelets, supplying not only the classic variants (996, 1105, 1110, 1111, 1120, 1185, 1197, 1205, 1220, 1424, 1516), but also versions with studs that were lacquered (725–727), polished (963, 1004), gemset (1007, 1114, 1115, 1190, 1208), miniature (1100), and even rounded for the first Royal Oak Offshore. Parallel to this increased collaboration with Lascor, cooperation with Gay Frères gradually dwindled. A few Royal Oak bracelets were still created in the 1980s and 1990s (692, 708, 994, 995), notably for bracelets entirely set with baguette-cut gems (861), before the Geneva company was bought out in 1998 by Rolex, its main historical customer. In addition, Audemars Piguet occasionally worked with a Swiss jeweller from French-speaking Switzerland, Vidoudez, which created Haute Joaillerie bracelets combining diamonds, emeralds and rubies for the Royal Oak (8054, 8027, 8081, 8083, 9031, 9042). Little by little, however, Audemars Piguet's Métiers d’Art workshop took over these tasks for most jewellery watches (8042, 9179, etc.) From the 2020s onwards, the Geneva-based firm Centror, which joined the Audemars Piguet group in 1991 after taking on the production of Royal Oak cases in precious materials, gradually began producing gold bracelets and acquiring the expertise required to manufacture the steel variants, even though most of them were still made by specialist workshops, including Orolux in the village of Noirmont. It should also be noted that the triple-blade clasp was introduced in the mid-1990s to improve the fit on the wrist of the first Royal Oak Offshore, Model 25721, of which around 300 to 500 featured the classic system. This innovation then progressively spread to the other collections, in particular the Royal Oak at the turn of the millennium. At the same time, Audemars Piguet began introducing Royal Oak ceramic bracelets. In 2007, the Manufacture in Le Brassus joined forces with the Swiss family-owned company Bangerter Mikrotechnik AG – based in the small village of Aaberg, between the cities of Biel and Bern – which had already produced ceramic Royal Oak bezels and cases. Until then, however, the complexity of the bracelet as well as its slimness and delicacy seemed incompatible with the extreme hardness of this material. A simplified method of comparison shows that ceramic (approx. 1300 Vickers) is some 6.5 times harder than steel (approx. 200 Vickers). It is worth recalling that machining steel was already a technical challenge in itself for the Royal Oak bracelet, even though it is only 30% harder than 18-carat gold! The objective was nevertheless achieved in 2017, with the presentation of the Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar 26579CE. It was an instant success, followed in 2017 by an openworked version 26585CE, a white ceramic interpretation 26579CB (approximately 9.25 times harder than steel!), as well as other complicated models such as the tourbillon 26522CE; the double balance wheel 15416CE, and the double-complication tourbillon chronograph 26343CE. While their role may seem less obvious at first glance, leather straps have nevertheless played a significant role in the Royal Oak’s history. For the first 20 years, the famous octagonal watch exclusively sported metal bracelets. In this field as in many others, purists considered this attribute untouchable, even sacred. For the record, in 1978, the first Royal Oak quartz watches gave up the octagonal bezel and its mechanical movement, while retaining the tapering metal bracelet. In 1992, the Royal Oak was nevertheless fitted with its first leather strap. Model 14800 was so controversial that Steven Urquhart and Georges-Henri Meylan, who were jointly helming the company at the time, had it developed &quot;extra-muros&quot; by independent Swiss designer Jörg Hysek. Interpreted in nearly 20 material and dial variants, this atypical Royal Oak takes great liberties in playing with its original codes, as much in terms of the dial as the hands and lugs. The bevel of the case is hollowed out in the centre, surrounded by a kind of lugs, which suggests that the strap is attached by means of mobile pivot bars. The careful observer will notice that the bracelet is clamped between the underside of the case middle and a long screw-down plate. This configuration is found on several later models, such as the Royal Oak 14890 (circa 1994), 14891, 14916 and 66800 (made during the mid-1990s). Some Royal Oak Offshore models retained this aesthetic, but by securing the strap to traditional bars, like the complete calendar 25808 (around 1996), Models 25807 (circa 1996), 25770 (around 1997) or the oversized models created in partnership with Arnold Schwarzenegger (End of Days 25770SN in 1999; T3 25863 in 2003; and The Legacy 26378 in 2010). At the turn of the millennium, Dirk Wettengel, who was in charge of distribution in Germany, suggested that the system for attaching the wristband be reviewed and pencilled a sketch. In Le Brassus, designer Claude Emmenegger had taken over since 1999 from Jacqueline Dimier and Emmanuel Gueit. The fastening system he developed on the basis of the German agent's design is more faithful to the Royal Oak’s original aesthetic, yet also more complex. The leather was cut to accommodate the first two metal studs of the strap and attached to them by means of two long interlocking screws. This solution replaced the lugs (or fake lugs) of the previous variants. More importantly, it did not affect the case middle, which remains identical for both leather and metal models. From then on, a watchmaker could therefore replace a leather strap with a metal version and vice-versa. This configuration was first introduced in 2001 on the Royal Oak Offshore 25940SK (rubber strap and bezel). The following year, the limited-edition Royal Oak City of Sails 25979 with a rubber strap heralded flexible straps with double studs in the Royal Oak collection. Presented in 2003 on the occasion of the opening of the Audemars Piguet boutique in New York, the limited edition 26014 is both the first Royal Oak to be blackened (using black PVD treatment), and the first to feature a leather strap with two studs. It was born at the instigation of François-Henry Bennahmias, who had just given a strong boost to the American distribution subsidiary. When he became CEO of the AP Group in 2012, leather straps were introduced throughout the Royal Oak collection. In 2004, the Royal Oak Chronograph 26022 was the first non-limited series to offer a leather alternative. The following year, when the Royal Oak 15300 replaced the old classic Model 14790 which had never sported a leather strap, it was offered with both metal bracelet and leather strap variants – and its successors 15400 (2012 and its derivatives) and 15500 (2019 and its derivatives) would continue this tradition. Soon, almost all the Royal Oak variations were equipped with this option, starting with chronographs (26068 from 2006; 26557 from 2011; 26320 and 26128 from 2012; 26331 from 2017; 26239 from 2021, etc). In 2006, a leather strap was introduced on the Dual Time (26120) and the double tourbillon chronograph complications (25977 then 26116 from 2007; 26377 and 26039 from 2010, etc.). It was not until 2008 that perpetual calendar models were equipped with them (26252). In 2010, the Equation of Time (26603) and the Royal Oak Day Date (26330) also adopted leather straps, as did the new openworked variant 15305. In 2012, even the Grand Complication succumbed to the trend (25990, 26065). For models in the current collection, a leather strap remains an alternative to metal. On the other hand, the limited editions are sometimes exclusively available with leather (or rubber) straps, such as the Royal Oak Sachin Tendulkar Chronograph 26161OR (2008), QEII Cup 2009 26277, the Royal Oak Tuxedo 15154 and 77220 in 2010; the Leo Messi edition 26325OL (2013), and the QEII Cup 2015 series, Model 26327TI, etc. In 1972, the Royal Oak bracelet no. 344 for the first time united two hitherto opposite worlds: hand-crafted jewellery bracelets whose history dates back to the origins of jewellery; and steel sports bracelets, which came into being with water-resistant men's wristwatches and were produced on an industrial scale. This integrated bracelet is one of the Royal Oak’s most recognisable features. Its wide, tapering links, punctuated by progressively smaller studs, are adorned with the same care as the case whose design they echo. Its development and production proved so complex that in the 1980s and 1990s, it was the Royal Oak cases that were adapted to the bracelet and not the other way round. Interpreted in dozens of variants, materials and sizes, the wristband has taken liberties over the decades, adopting leather from the 1990s, including an embroidered version in 2008 (67607), then rubber, platinum, titanium as well as ceramic. With an eye to the future, Audemars Piguet also presented in November 2021 its first Royal Oak bracelet combining sandblasted titanium (links) with polished Bulk Metallic Glass (studs) for the unique Royal Oak “Jumbo” Extra-Thin timepiece dedicated to the Only Watch charity auction. Notably used in micro-electronics, this new palladium-based alloy – used for the first time at Audemars Piguet – shares several characteristics with other glasses when cooled rapidly, including amorphicity and high strength, making it particularly resistant to wear and corrosion. This unique piece ushers in a new generation of Royal Oak bracelets requiring the development of new manufacturing techniques and tools. In 2022, on the occasion of the Royal Oak’s 50th anniversary, Audemars Piguet is adding a new subtlety: the bracelet taper that had previously been applied to the width alone for our metal bracelets is now reflected in the decreasing thickness of the first links. Editorial board: Audemars Piguet Heritage team, Le Brassus First publication: 10 May 2022",timeline:G,period:l,imageFileReference:de,mobileFileReference:a,size:a,material:[],duration:df}},{_index:g,_type:h,_id:bb,_score:f,_source:{title:cS,pagePath:bb,templateType:k,content:"Model 5402 Dial Variants The dial of Model 5402 combines two complementary geometrical shapes: the circle and the square. Curved and straight lines, straightness and fluidity; or more symbolically rigorous discipline and flexibility. On the one hand, the circular shape of the dial is highlighted by the 12 applied hour-markers, finely punctuated by the minute markers and, above all, by the tens of thousands of tiny diamond shapes carved into concentric circles. On the other hand, the square shape is expressed through the hundreds of small, flattened pyramids aligned in a checkerboard pattern, crisscrossed by the same number of horizontal and vertical lines, like the streets of a city. This verticality is reinforced by the axis between the double 12 o'clock hour-marker and the AP monogram at 6 o'clock, while the horizontality is based on the AUDEMARS PIGUET signature, accentuated by the AUTOMATIC indication and the date window at 3 o'clock. It is also worth noting that the latter creates an asymmetrical effect because, as is widely acknowledged, a harmoniously pleasing face is always slightly asymmetrical. This subtle combination of geometrical shapes takes on its full meaning when viewed in relation to the Royal Oak's faceted case, which also plays with shapes. The bezel is indeed a rounded octagon and the monocoque case is shaped like a tonneau (barrel). Thus, like the watch case and perhaps even more so, the dial of the Royal Oak is designed to reflect light, superimposing several patterns featuring different geometries to create infinitely varied moiré effects. The article dedicated to the birth of the Royal Oak recounts the development of the famous 5402 dial. It recalls how the prestigious Geneva dial-maker Stern, who had just – somewhat by chance – inherited some old guilloché machines, suggested to designer Gérald Genta that he use them to model the face of the future Royal Oak. It also explains how the pattern was chosen and why the craftsmen opted for a galvanic colouring treatment. When Stern Créations ceased its activities in 2016, some of its archives were distributed to its former clients. This represented a rare and welcome initiative conducive to long-term transmission of watchmaking knowledge and expertise. Audemars Piguet inherited more than 30 linear metres of documents, consisting of thousands of plans, files, orders, correspondence and reference dials. Among them was the first Royal Oak dial, pictured here. The &quot;benchmark dial&quot; is glued to a cardboard sheet next to which are technical indications, unfortunately all too often impossible to understand. In this article we will examine those that are still comprehensible, in particular &quot;Tapisserie T21&quot;; the &quot;Bleu Nuit 1 + N50&quot; colour; the &quot;satin-finished&quot; &quot;ultra-thin 12\u002F100” AP monogram; and the openworked &quot;trit&quot; (for tritium) hour-markers. The Stern archive indicates that the guilloché pattern is labelled 'T21', an abbreviation of ‘Tapisserie No. 21'. The name Tapisserie deserves a small aside. The watchmaking world, and more particularly that of collectors, has become accustomed to using the term Tapisserie to describe the Royal Oak's dial motifs. This metonymy results from the fame of the model. As stated by the website of the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie (FHH), tapisserie means &quot;a pattern of repetitive motifs, similar to a tapestry. A die of this motif guides the movement of the tool on a specially adapted rose engine.” Most of the Tapisserie designs in the Stern archive are floral or arabesque motifs. The T21 pattern, on the other hand, is loosely inspired by the Clous de Paris guilloché pattern that can be traced back to at least the 18th century and consists of small pyramids with square bases. Adopted for Model 5402, the T21 motif became widespread in the Royal Oak collection from 1976 onwards, particularly on Models 8638, 4100, etc. At the beginning of the 21st century, its name changed to Petite Tapisserie, in contrast to a larger variant created in 1999, known as Grande Tapisserie, which replaced it within a few years. In 2012, for the Royal Oak’s 40th anniversary, the Petite Tapisserie made a comeback on Model 15202 which also bears the AP monogram at 6 o'clock. Since 1972, Model 5402 dials have been made on special machines, which have a long history that we retrace in a dedicated article. During the first decades, the working methods and the tools used led to significant aesthetic variations from one batch of dials to another. Canadian Marc Ferland, who oversaw the Tapisserie dial workshop from 2011 to 2021, explains that although the machines have been perfected, the method remains artisanal, as adjustments can considerably modify the engraving: &quot;The machines are designed to reproduce the patterns of the chablon (the matrix) in a miniaturised way, somewhat like pantographs. In fact, they do much more than produce slavish copies since they interpret the motif. So much so indeed that – with a little skill – an artisan can turn squares into flowers!” In the 1970s and 80s, the centring of the truncated pyramids sometimes differed slightly from one dial to another (see illustrations). The dimensions of the pyramids also sometimes varied considerably, not only in height and width, as did their number! To confirm that, all you need to do is count the number of pyramids between the date window and the dial centre. Over that same distance, some dials have 9 pyramids, others 10 or even 11, meaning a 20% variation! It is important to know that the large matrixes used on the engraving machines wore out quickly and had to be replaced regularly. As they were also made by hand, they were slightly different from each other. In addition, the size and number of squares could be changed considerably by adjusting the machine. Between each of the pyramids, and partially on top of them, an extremely fine dotted line plays with the light. Marc Ferland explains: &quot;We fix the dial on the guilloché machine and it then begins spinning on its axis.” And as it turns, the sharpened tip of a burin makes small holes without ever going through the metal, like a woodpecker digging its nest. In one complete turn, it enters the material 339.5 times and comes within an 11th of a millimetre of the dial centre. For a dial with a 28 mm diameter, it takes 154 turns to cover the entire metal surface with over 50,000 microscopic holes. But if you walk into Marc Ferland's workshop and talk to him about &quot;little dots&quot;, he immediately responds: &quot;They're not dots, they're diamond shapes! If they were round, the dial wouldn't shine.” Each diamond shape has four small inner faces that reflect the light. More importantly, because the number of diamonds is the same for each turn, the closer the circles get to the dial centre, the closer the holes also get. &quot;That's when you'll see new curved lines appear, formed by the ever-tighter pattern”, enthuses Marc Ferland, who completes the picture with technical explanations that are as passionately detailed as they are abstruse for the uninitiated, punctuated by terms such as &quot;rosettes&quot;, &quot;cam&quot;, &quot;ideal angle&quot; and &quot;pointer.&quot; The Stern card defines the colour of the 5402ST dial as Bleu Nuit 1 + N50. This code corresponds to a kind of recipe. The Bleu Nuit, no 1 colour was created by Stern, which has jealously guarded its trade secret. N50 stands for &quot;Nuage (cloud) No. 50&quot; and corresponds to the black colour No. 50 added to the protective varnish (or zapon) of the dial. The term &quot;cloud&quot; is said to derive from the cloud that the drop of colour forms when it enters the liquid varnish. Blue has always been the most difficult colour to reproduce perfectly. The hue is obtained by immersing the dials in a galvanic bath. While the formulation of the mixture is important, the duration of the bath and the temperature are also crucial. If the artisan removes the dial just a little too early, it comes out purple, and if removed too late, it will have turned black. The exercise is further complicated by the fact that the dial looks rather grey when emerging from the bath and it is only when the protective varnish is applied (the one to which a drop of black is added) that the blue begins to show. Varnish stabilises the colour but does not prevent its long-term evolution. Prolonged exposure to light or humidity gradually changes the colour, creating a patina that is at times aesthetically close to the original and at others quite remote. To ascertain the original colour, one must observe the back of the dial, to which access requires the skill and tools of a specialised watchmaker. Hidden from view and from the light, the back of the dial is not destined for observation, yet it contains information of interest to both collectors and watchmakers. On the one hand, its colour remains closer to the original. In this respect, the Audemars Piguet Heritage team was surprised to discover slightly purplish reflections, which suggest that in 1972, some dials must have had a very different colour from what we usually imagine. On the other hand, the back of the dial is engraved. The reference book written by Helmut Crott entitled Le cadran, visage de la montre-bracelet au 20e siècle unlocks the code: &quot;the 6 designates the Audemars Piguet customer, while the star corresponds to the Stern Frères hallmark at the time.” The following number represents the order number, as confirmed by the Audemars Piguet archives. On the other hand, Helmut Crott indicates that 4N (appearing here as &quot;N4&quot;) refers to the colour of 4N gold, but this information is not corroborated by sources, since analysis conducted by the Audemars Piguet laboratory has shown that the plates of the first Royal Oak dials are made from a variety of bronze called Chrysoscale. Finally, the watchmaker will be able to check at a glance if the dial has been refurbished in the course of its history, by examining the colour, the finish, as well as the feet of the hour-markers and the AP monogram. Redoing a dial colour entails removing and then refitting the applied elements (hour-markers and logo) and such an operation always leaves traces. One of the distinctive features of the original Royal Oak dial is the applied AP monogram. Based on known records, this was a first for Audemars Piguet. The two juxtaposed letters A and P had been used in advertising material before, but they had hardly ever adorned the dial of a watch. The Stern technical data sheet (see &quot;The Stern technical data sheet&quot; section above) provides a red indication inviting artisans to ensure that the height of the AP not exceed &quot;12\u002F100&quot; of a millimetre. The Royal Oak watch was indeed ultra-thin, since the space between the dial and the crystal amounted to no more than 0.9 mm, just enough to leave enough room for the hours and minutes hands. Making such a thin white gold monogram proved all the more difficult in that the vertical bar of the A and that of the P touch each other, thus requiring the cutting of a small relief (0.002 mm deep, half a hair's breadth) between the two. There is another indication that deserves collectors’ attention. &quot;Symb AP 945 satin finish&quot; means that the AP symbol (monogram) bearing reference number 945 at Stern must be satin-finished. Whereas the vast majority of the applied logos were in fact satin-finished rather than polished, the archives do not explain this change. Several hypotheses circulating in the Audemars Piguet Customer Service workshops have sought to explain this change. According to the first, satin-finishing such thin components would have proven too difficult. The second holds that the change might have made it possible to improve the legibility of the letters AP by creating a contrast. A belated &quot;+ white line on AP&quot; mention on the Stern technical data sheet appears to support the latter version, by indicating that the gap between the two letters was sometimes coloured white to improve legibility. Collectors have long since known that while the first generation of 5402ST has the AP monogram at 6 o'clock, many examples are equipped with later dials featuring an AP logo at 12 o’clock. Here again, while the archives do not document the reason for this change, watchmakers’ memories fill that gap. Restorers explain how, after several years, certain watch hands begin to rub or even bump into the applied logo, sometimes to the point of stopping the watch. Within this context is it important to remember that the distance between the hand and the logo is five to ten hundredths of a millimetre! Some artisans have humorously noted that it was almost as hard to get the hand through this narrow passage as for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. To solve the problem, Customer Service watchmakers initially used to bend the hands manually, a tricky operation that consisted of creating two tiny, inverted Z-shaped bends to raise the two hands high enough to pass without touching either the logo or the glass and without touching each other. However, in order to provide a permanent solution, Audemars Piguet decided on February 24, 1977 to move the logo to 12 o’clock, so as to leave sufficient space for the movement of the hours hand. The next day, a first order for 210 &quot;new execution&quot; dials was sent to Stern. This decision might lead one to assume that from spring 1977 onwards, all new Royal Oak 5402 watches featured the new dial with monogram at 12 o'clock. This is not the case and to understand why, it is important to know that between 1972 and the last order of March 1977, Audemars Piguet ordered 4,336 of the 5402 dials, whereas during that same period the company sold 2,978 Royal Oak 5402 watches. That meant that by the spring of 1977, over 1,200 dials with the 6 o’clock monogram were still in stock! The archives documenting the dial change reveal little and do not for example mention when the first watch with an AP monogram at 12 o'clock was produced or when the last new 5402 with the monogram at 6 o'clock was delivered. They remain equally silent regarding the timepieces on which dials with the monogram at 6 o’clock were replaced by “12 o’clock” variants. Worse still, they do not even reveal whether the two variants ever coexisted. As is often the case, historians have to be ingenious and build hypotheses. Let's first take a look at the big numbers. From 1971 to 1990, Audemars Piguet ordered a total of 6,983 dials for Model 5402, of which 5,189 were blue, 1,548 slate grey and 246 gold-toned (also referred to as &quot;brown&quot;). Of these, at least 62% had the AP monogram at 6 o'clock. More importantly, Audemars Piguet ordered 911 more dials than the number of watches sold! This implies that a maximum of 15% of 5402 watches could potentially have had their dials replaced in the Audemars Piguet workshops. Let us focus exclusively on the Bleu nuit, Nuage 50 variant with white gold hour-markers, intended for the stainless steel Royal Oak 5402ST. Between 1971 and 1990, the company ordered a total of 4,992 dials, of which at least 4,085 have an AP monogram at 6 o'clock – implying that a maximum of 907 had it in the 12 o’clock position. In an amusing little exercise, assuming that each of the last 907 Royal Oak watches sold were equipped with a dial bearing a logo at 12 o'clock, the dial change would have taken place in the spring of 1978, i.e. around number 1500 of the C series (see article on 5402 serial numbers). This is unlikely, since we know that many 12 o'clock dials were used to replace earlier variants. Another theoretical exercise, this time in reverse. If Audemars Piguet had used the 4,085 dials with the AP monogram at 6 o'clock available in stock before starting to use the dials with AP at 12 o'clock, the watchmakers would have started to equip 5402 watches with AP at 12 o'clock dials in November 1981, corresponding to the end of the D series. Only 219 new watches would have been fitted with this dial at the time of their first sale. This hypothesis is even more improbable because it implies that Audemars Piguet would have waited more than three years between the order of the first “6 o'clock” dials and their first use! The truth probably lies somewhere between these two extremes, between February 1977 and November 1981. In conclusion: if it was seamless, the change probably took place towards the end of 1978. If it was slow, which is more likely, the two variants probably coexisted between the summer of 1977 and the summer of 1979. The only certainty, based on dial orders, is that of the 4,304 examples of the 5402ST, a maximum of 16% have the AP monogram at 12 o’clock. The Stern technical data sheet indicates several cliché numbers. The French term cliché refers to metal plates engraved by means of an acid-based photographic process and used to transfer inscriptions: signatures, railway-type minute tracks and indications of origin. Printing tiny letters on a base with as many depth effects as the Tapisserie proved tricky, as the paint ran down the side of the pyramids and entered the small diamond-shaped holes before drying. To 'smooth out the terrain' and fill the holes, dial-makers first printed two layers of transparent ink, then switched to two layers of white paint. This process is still used today. Just as the colour of the dials may vary slightly from one watch to another, the position of the transfers may differ slightly, as do the thickness of the lettering and the lines. However, the brand name generally appears within a triangle formed by the extremities of the hour-markers at 10, 12 and 2 o'clock. Note that the AUTOMATIC indication extends slightly below the triangle (see diagrams). This indication migrated permanently to 6 o'clock when the monogram AP replaced the double hour-marker at 12 o’clock. The second transferred element is very discreet: between each end of the hour-markers, four tiny radiating lines mark the minutes and subtly accentuate the roundness of the dial. Attentive connoisseurs will have noticed that the three half-lines for the minutes on the right of the date aperture appear only on the original 5402 dials. Even the dials refurbished by Stern in the 1980s no longer incorporate them. Finally, the third element is even more discreet and consists of a reminder of the Swiss origin of the watch just below the 6 o'clock hour-marker. A distant descendant of the watchmaking guild hallmarks of the 17th century, the Swiss Made indication guarantees the quality of watches bearing it. Protected by an ordinance since 1971, it complements the numbers engraved on the watches and their movements; the multiple hallmarks (precious material, dial-maker, case-maker, bracelet, etc.); the engravings relating to the number of jewels; and of course the dial signature. On Audemars Piguet dials, the indication of origin gradually established itself. In the 19th century, &quot;Le Brassus&quot; occasionally appeared beneath the trademark. From the 1930s to the late 1960s, this same position was often occupied by the &quot;Genève&quot; toponym, a reminder that Audemars Piguet had a complications workshop in this city. As for the name SWISS appearing in small letters below the hour-marker at 6 o'clock, it progressively asserted itself from the 1920s onwards. By the 1970s, it had become the norm – so much so that all the first Royal Oak watches were fitted with it. Over time, dials develop a patina. They can become scratched and oxidised. The dial restorers then suggest “refurbishing” them, an operation which consists in dismantling the appliques, removing the paint, the varnish and the colour, as well as the oxidation. The dial is then given a facelift that involves redoing the electroplating, transfers and repositioning the refurbished hour-markers, while the guilloché work on the Tapisserie pattern is never touched up. While the &quot;refurbishment operations&quot; comply with the original techniques and aesthetics, they sometimes show traces of the period in which they were performed. For example, the SWISS indication that appeared below the 6 o’clock hour-marker until around 1985 was replaced from that date onwards (approximately) by a SWISS MADE indication. This minor change, to which contemporaries probably did not attach any particular importance, has become an important criterion for collectors in the valuation of watches, as has the position of the applied AP monogram. The reason is simple. When a dial bears the indication &quot;SWISS MADE&quot;, it means that it was either completed or refreshed after the mid-1980s. The Audemars Piguet Heritage team has scoured the archives and tapped former employees’ memories at length in order to find the reason for this change. It seems to be simply aesthetic: the two words SWISS and MADE on either side of the hour-markers at 6 o’clock help balance the dial. It should also be noted that the SWISS MADE indication may have appeared on 5402 watches when they were first marketed, as the last 133 examples were sold between 1985 and 2002. The collector community highly values timepieces that encompass the signatures of two prestigious brands on the dial: collectors’ admiration for each brand combines in one single object. As far as the 5402 Royal Oak is concerned, the extreme rarity of double signatures makes these models particularly coveted. Such is the case of a few Audemars Piguet timepieces co-signed by Bulgari, Tiffany or Chaumet. To better understand the double signature, we need to go back in time to Audemars Piguet’s inception in 1875. Painstakingly working at their workbench in an isolated valley situated in the Jura mountains, the handful of Audemars Piguet watchmakers had limited and rare access to their end clients. They relied on distributors, as well as other watchmakers and jewellers, such as Tiffany, Cartier, Gübelin or Bulgari to name but a few, that were already established in some of the most prestigious metropolises. These brands often added their name on the watches produced in the Vallée de Joux either because they were in charge of their distribution or because they participated in their creation. Over the years, reverence for Audemars Piguet increased within the collectors’ circle – a growing reputation reflected by the progressive rise of watches signed by Audemars Piguet. Until the mid-20th century, the brand’s signature was often accompanied by the retailer’s name. However, from the 1950s onwards, the Le Brassus brand affirmed itself and the double signature became less common. In the 1970s, it had become the exception. Even more important, the practice had changed. Before the 1970s, Audemars Piguet watchmakers ordered dials signed by other brands and assembled them in the Le Brassus workshops. In 1972, brands at times added their own signature after receiving the finished watch. As a result, Audemars Piguet’s archives have no record of double signatures for Model 5402. Yet, the destination city can sometimes offer an interesting clue. For instance, a dial co-signed by Tiffany is more likely to be original if Audemars Piguet delivered the watch to the jeweller’s headquarters in New York, rather than to Tokyo or Paris. However, this information cannot provide definitive evidence. Only the brand that co-signed the dial can certify, if recorded in its archives, that a watch had the double signature when it was first commercialised. In 1977, the Royal Oak 5402 was interpreted for the first time in yellow gold, white gold and in a two-tone version. The guilloché dials followed the trend by offering a variety of colours, changing the material of the monogram and the hour-markers and even replacing the latter with diamonds. Slate Grey Dials Between February 1977 and September 1990, 1,548 &quot;slate grey&quot; dials were ordered to equip the two-tone 5402SA model. At least 220 of these had an AP monogram at 6 o'clock and at least 980 at 12 o’clock. The dial colour recalled the stainless steel of the case and bracelet, while the yellow gold hour-markers echoed the gold of the bezel and the studs. It is worth noting that while the Tapisserie pattern is the most emblematic, dials without this decoration emerged during the late 1970s in different colour variants as presented here. Brown (or Gilded) Dials Produced in a run of 740, Model 5402BA most often featured blue dials punctuated by yellow gold hour-markers. However, this model was also equipped with 146 gilded dials, including 25 with the AP monogram at 6 o'clock, 76 at 12 o’clock and 45 whose position is not specified in the archives. It should be noted that gilded variants with AP at 6 o'clock are extremely rare. No examples have been received by the AP Customer Service since 2000. Gemset Dials The archives record 23 orders for dials with diamond hour-markers. Blue, gilded or slate grey, with square or round studs, intended for Model 5402 or its 4187 gemset derivative, they revive the tradition of very small series or even one-of-a-kind models. The Royal Oak's hour-markers and hands have always been in gold. Both speak the same aesthetic language of gentle curves and lightness. Gérald Genta, designer of Model 5402, described them as follows: &quot;hour-markers and hands in the shape of rings framing the luminous material, which creates an extremely delicate effect.” The term baignoire (bathtub) was widely used in the Audemars Piguet workshops, obviously by analogy with respect to the shape, but certainly also because the hollowed-out (openworked) interior was filled with additional material: tritium. The use of luminescent materials on watch dials was widespread throughout the 20th century. In an article published in the Swiss daily newspaper Le Temps in June 2018, Iaz Chams explains that radium, discovered by Marie Curie in 1898, was long perceived as beneficial to health. It was used everywhere, even in fabrics: &quot;Radioactive underwear from the Iradia brand was promoted for skiing!” It was also touted as an ingredient in antidepressant pills, because &quot;taking radioactivity means absorbing life.&quot; In the Swiss watchmaking industry, thousands of women worked as &quot;radioluminators&quot;, manually applying radium to the dials, hour-markers and hands of mostly sports watches. In the United States, &quot;Radium Girls&quot; performed the same tasks. Their story is told in a film of the same name, directed by Lydia Dean Pilcher and released in 2018. In the 1930s and 1940s, some Audemars Piguet chronograph watches were equipped with radium. However, once it became aware of the dangerous nature of this material, the company in Le Brassus gave up its use in 1957, six years ahead of the regulation established by the Swiss government on the subject. As the night-time luminescence of dials was a much-appreciated quality, the industry began looking for an alternative. It subsequently adopted tritium, a less radioactive material. For watches with a radioactivity level of less than 7.5 mCi – and such was the case with the Royal Oak – there was no obligation to mention the presence of tritium, whereas others had to feature a T on the dial. It should be noted that tritium was progressively replaced from February 1999 onwards by Super-LumiNova©, a non-radioactive phosphorescent material that must accumulate light in order to restore it, in contrast to the &quot;self-luminescent&quot; materials that preceded it. The early Royal Oak hands are slightly different from the more modern hands. A trained eye (with the aid of a good magnifying glass or even a microscope) will recognise the older generations by their flatter, wider metal surface and a line of luminescent material. Watchmakers call these &quot;flattened hands&quot; and they are only found on Model 5402. As later models had more space between the glass and the dial, the hands were no longer &quot;flattened&quot;, meaning that from Models 8638 and 4100 onwards, the visible metal part was more raised, thinner and left more space for the luminescent material. The dial of the first Royal Oak watches is a masterpiece of technical and aesthetic design that can be admired on several levels. From a distance, its moiré reflections play with the light while maintaining perfect legibility of the time. Viewed at close-hand, hundreds of small square pyramids with truncated tops (some view them as chocolate squares) are juxtaposed in a checkerboard pattern that accentuates the watch's horizontal and vertical lines. When seen under a microscope, the dial becomes a landscape punctuated by tens of thousands of diamond shapes that sometimes overlap and create complex curves. Interpreted over the last 50 years in countless variants, the Tapisserie pattern has become one of the essential codes of the Royal Oak: larger or smaller, evolving, radiating, etc. This omnipresence should however not obscure the fact that – as early as the late 1970s – the Royal Oak also featured more classical dials without guilloché motifs, one of the most significant being that of the first Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar, Model 5554 released in 1984.

From 1977 onwards, Model 8638 was interpreted in two-tone and yellow gold versions. The first white gold version followed in 1978. Its total production run amounted to approximately 3,889 timepieces, mainly between 1976 and 1980, although sales continued until around 1990.

In April 1970, when designer Gérald Genta was inspired by the memory of a scuba diver to design the bezel and its visible screws, he was probably not thinking of women. In September 1971, when Audemars Piguet and the publicist Hugo Buchser sought a name for the future icon, they started looking for &quot;names evoking sport, open spaces or virility.” As for the 1972 campaign, it was explicitly aimed at “discerning men of action”, and even at &quot;men of steel&quot;, by analogy with the material of the watch. How can one explain the fact that the first Royal Oak evolution was feminine? Model 8638 was launched in 1976, even before the legendary Model 5402 was interpreted in precious materials! &quot;Behind every man is a woman,” the saying goes and it appears that femininity has been embedded in the Royal Oak since its birth. American watch expert and historian Michael Friedman reminds us that Gérald Genta was first and foremost a jeweller and that this sensitivity is reflected in many of his creations. It is certainly true that the multiple facets of the case and bracelet play with light like the facets of a diamond. One may also recall that during the first decades of the history of wristwatches, men almost systematically adopted leather straps, considering metal bracelets as feminine attributes. This means that the 1972 Royal Oak already featured a feminine touch and the observation reminds us that in watchmaking, the question of gender has evolved in step with cultural change. Historically, the question of whether a watch is feminine or masculine has not always been relevant. In the 16th and 17th centuries, timepieces were rarely designed with one specific gender in mind. They were distinguished primarily by their rarity and high value. Owning them was above all an expression of belonging to a particular socio-cultural category. They were rarely worn, and when they were, both men and women usually wore them around their necks. This dynamic evolved from the 18th century onwards. Little by little, women's watches were adorned with precious stones and miniature enamel paintings depicting pastoral scenes, flowers or foliage. Watches became so miniaturised that they were sometimes confused with jewellery. At the same time, in the Western world, men gave up colours and jewels to adopt dark suits from the 19th century onwards. Their watches grew more restrained and at the same time more accurate, while the most prestigious were equipped with horological complications. In the 20th century, the wristwatch became the norm for both men and women, yet the gender distinction remained. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, the cultural revolution began to blur the lines. Since 1875, most of women’s watches at Audemars Piguet have been distinguished from men's watches by two qualities. Firstly, their dainty size, which has remained a constant to this day. In order to fit women’s slimmer wrists, timepieces are miniaturised, sometimes to the extreme. This drastically increases the production difficulty and the value of their movements, when these are mechanical. Secondly, women’s watches are often richly ornamented, featuring cases and bracelets embellished with fine and precious stones, enamels, pearls, etc. This second quality is nonetheless less consistent than the first. As early as the 19th century, pendant repeater watches, for example, were rarely set with diamonds. In the 1920s and during the post-war boom period, certain models stood out by their unusual design, with taut lines, complex and innovative geometries, non-figurative textures, plays on asymmetry, etc. In their own way, these more understated watches paved the way for the feminine Royal Oak and contributed to a gradual gender rapprochement in watchmaking. The project for the first women’s Royal Oak began in 1973. At that time, the third generation of the Audemars and Piguet founding families were still working daily in the Le Brassus ateliers. However, since 1967, the man at the helm of the brand was Georges Golay, a visionary entrepreneur who had been involved in the company’s modernisation since 1945. Notably benefiting from the success of the Royal Oak, Audemars Piguet had the wind in its sails and went from 84 employees in 1972 to 125 two years later, an almost 50% spurt in growth. Turnover doubled during the same period to reach 25 million Swiss francs. Despite these pleasing figures, the global context was explosive. In 1971, the United States abandoned the Gold Standard, shaking the world economy. Following Richard Nixon’s decision, the dollar was no longer converted into a fixed amount of gold. In 1973, a first oil crisis sparked a period of monetary instability that would last ten years, characterised by galloping inflation, a surge in gold prices and a second oil crisis in 1978. This spelt the end of the post-war boom period. The entirely export-oriented Swiss watch industry was hard hit by this crisis, notably due to the high value of the Swiss franc. This weakening was aggravated by the tidal wave of quartz watches manufactured by Japanese and American electronics giants. In ten years, 1,000 Swiss watchmaking companies vanished, taking with them two-thirds of the jobs in the industry! Thanks to its high-end positioning and some bold decisions, Audemars Piguet was largely spared by the crisis, even doubling the number of its employees between 1974 and 1984 and increasing its production from 9,000 to 11,000 watches per year. Periods of crisis are conducive to new, radical ideas that would probably not have seen the light of day in any other context – and it was no different for the first women’s Royal Oak. By way of reminder, the Royal Oak created intense controversy in 1972 by displaying screws on its bezel and treating steel as a noble metal. At the time, steel was already used in countless mid-range and high-end men's watches, while the dainty women's watches were almost all made of precious materials. The visible screws symbolised resistance, strength and technology, which had long been perceived as masculine qualities. Maintaining these codes for a woman's watch could therefore be perceived not only as a provocation, but also as a manifesto. Georges Golay and Jacques-Louis Audemars were well aware of this. They also knew that it would have been easier to make this watch in gold, a much more malleable material ideal for diamonds. Just as it would have been simpler to equip the watch with a small hand-wound or quartz calibre, as miniature selfwinding movements were both rare and delicate. Nonetheless, Audemars Piguet opted to take the high road and make no concessions in developing the &quot;Royal Oak II&quot;. For the first 100 years of its existence, Audemars Piguet used external designers to design its watches. One of the most prominent among them was Gérald Genta, who worked with the Manufacture for nearly 20 years and founded his own watch brand after designing the Royal Oak. However, Georges Golay sought a more permanent solution. Following the example of Piaget, which since 1967 had enriched its team by recruiting the designer Jean-Claude Gueit, the “rainbow” setting creator, Audemars Piguet’s managing director decided to integrate this role into the company. In 1972, he hired 21-year-old Jean-Fred Meylan, a native of the Vallée de Joux, whom the employee register describes as a “jeweller”. For three years, Jean-Fred Meylan designed numerous ultra-thin models with pure lines, the most famous of which featured dials inspired by the screens of the first televisions. He designed the first Audemars Piguet quartz watch, Model 6001, equipped with a very high-frequency calibre. Presented in 1974, it was admired but its thick case made it rather unpopular. The collaboration was short lived and on January 6, 1975, Audemars Piguet hired one of the first female designers in the industry: Jacqueline Dimier. This time, the register indicates her profession as “stylist”. More experienced than Jean-Fred Meylan, she designed the majority of Audemars Piguet watches for 24 years. A graphic designer by training, Jacqueline Dimier entered the world of object design via that of jewellery by chance. For a Geneva-based designer, turning to watchmaking was a natural progression. After a few years, she began offering watch designs to Patek Philippe, Vacheron Constantin and Rolex. Her success was such that the latter company offered her a position, which she held for seven years. This experience at Rolex was invaluable in helping her understand the interdependence between creativity and feasibility, beauty and technique. Every designer knows that an idea only comes to life when it is embodied in an object. Making timepieces involves significant constraints, since these small and complex objects must both deliver time and resist it, particularly in wearing conditions that can place it in jeopardy. In a 2017 interview, Jacqueline Dimier remembered how, upon arriving at Audemars Piguet on January 6, 1975, she had just two months for her predecessor Jean-Fred Meylan to hand over and to fine-tune the new models presented in April at the European Watch and Jewellery Show in Basel. She explained that the watches and Haute Joaillerie prototypes were kept on a shelf behind the designer's desk at the time. When she expressed her surprise at the lack of security, Jean-Fred Meylan is said to have replied: “Nothing untoward can happen in the Vallée de Joux.” The beginnings of the women's Royal Oak preceded the arrival of Jacqueline Dimier. The archives contain an anonymous gouache painting, probably done by Jean-Fred Meylan, featuring a pencilled annotation indicating that it dated from 1973. Dated July 26, 1974, the earliest plans are from the Italian case maker Fernando Fontana, a company based in Sesto Calende, at the far end of Lake Maggiore. Northern Italian artisans such as Brera and Fumagalli had been longstanding suppliers of high-end watch exterior components to the Swiss watch industry, particularly to Audemars Piguet. Well acquainted with the brand’s Italian agent Carlo de Marchi, Fontana knew how to work steel, which is undoubtedly what convinced Jacques-Louis Audemars to entrust him with the first women's Royal Oak, while the bracelet was to be crafted by Gay Frères in Geneva. In January 1975, Jacqueline Dimier inherited a project that was already well under way, yet faced the challenge of revising its aesthetic harmony. The proportions of the Royal Oak had to be entirely revisited. In the above-mentioned interview, Jacqueline Dimier explained that it was not possible to miniaturise such a model without reworking its architecture and proportions. She recalled the technical challenges of the operation: “The eight hexagonal screws running through the entire case are a major constraint because they directly influence the proportions of the bezel and, consequently, the entire aesthetic balance of the watch.” Jacqueline Dimier also recalled that the specifications required the watch to be equipped with a selfwinding calibre featuring a 6 ¾-ligne diameter, i.e. 15.4 mm! A risky gamble, as small dimensions are often not well-suited to a selfwinding system. The movement chosen was Calibre 2062. Its blank was manufactured by the Rayville factory in Villeret, heir to the Blancpain company, a member of the SSIH (Société Suisse pour l’Industrie Horlogère), and a major supplier to Omega. Audemars Piguet joined forces with LeCoultre &amp; Cie to adapt the calibre. The watchmakers in Le Brassus were in charge of the finishing, which was to be resolutely high-end. The oscillating weight was redesigned to be produced in 21-carat gold, another characteristic inherited from the original Royal Oak: “a steel case housing a mechanical treasure partially made of gold.” To accommodate a movement measuring 4.25 mm thick, Jacqueline Dimier had to design a correspondingly generous case and created a raised caseback in order to maintain a slim profile. The dial featured the same T21 “Petite Tapisserie” motif and the “Bleu Nuit, Nuage 50” (Night Blue, Cloud 50) colour of the 1972 model. However, since it was much smaller than its predecessor, Jacqueline Dimier decided to add a lighter visual touch by placing the white gold “AP” monogram at 12 o’clock for the first time. It is this detail that made all the difference. This key element subsequently appeared on Model 8638 variants, on the latest generations of Model 5402 as well as on countless future Royal Oak watches, starting with Model 4100. Since the 1940s, Audemars Piguet had presented its new products at the Basel Fair. Every year, this not-to-be-missed event brought together all the Swiss and European brands for ten days and attracted all the industry professionals who came from all over the world to discover the new products and take orders. In 1976, the fair was held from April 26 to May 3 and the Royal Oak II played a central role on the Audemars Piguet booth. However, for this exceptional watch, the brand from Le Brassus had departed from its usual rule. The first ten timepieces, numbered from 00 to 09, had already been unveiled to the public three weeks earlier at an exhibition at the jeweller FRED on rue Royale in Paris. The Royal Oak 8638 was an immediate success, so much so that the workshops struggled to meet the growing demand. In 1976, 428 watches were sold and the following year, 765 left Le Brassus. The figure was close to the 1,000 mark in 1978 and exceeded it in 1979. The success of the women's Royal Oak was such that it turned the spotlight on all other Audemars Piguet ladies’ watches. By 1976 already, the number of feminine watches on offer had increased by 55% to over a quarter of total production and reached one-third a year later. Whether for men or women, the first Royal Oak watches were all made of steel. The concept was radical and made a lasting impression. It enabled the watch to make its mark and began writing a new chapter in the history of Haute Horlogerie. It did not however meet the increasingly pressing market demand for variants in precious materials. The year 1977 witnessed the appearance of the first gold Royal Oak models. Some purists feared that the renunciation of the original concept in its most orthodox form would dilute the Royal Oak’s strength. Time has proven otherwise. The 8638BA variant in yellow gold was well received from 1977 onwards, with 112 watches sold, followed by an annual average of around 250. The more spectacular two-tone 8638SA version, which innovated by combining steel with yellow gold, proved a particular hit and 283 were sold in the year of its launch, a figure that doubled over the next two years! The adventurous 1972 Royal Oak was the first series-made model in Audemars Piguet’s history to bear a name. The addition of Model 8638 in 1976 demonstrated that it could break its own rules and by 1977, the addition of new materials and dimensions gave it the status of a collection in its own right.

Audemars Piguet joined forces with LeCoultre &amp; Cie to adapt the mechanism – with the latter company manufacturing the gold oscillating weight, while the Le Brassus watchmakers were responsible for assembly, finishing and casing-up. The majority of the approximately 4,000 units produced between 1976 and 1980 were cased up in Model 8638. In the mid-1980s, a new generation of miniature selfwinding calibres was introduced: thinner and slightly larger than Calibre 2062. Calibres 2130 (which notably equipped the Royal Oak 14470), 2150 and 2132\u002F2805 with perpetual calendar had a diameter of 20.4 mm, while Calibres 2131 (Royal Oak 14486) and 2151 measured 23.3 mm. Calibre 2140 succeeded them in the 1990s.

Its unprecedented concept sent shock waves through the traditionally muted world of luxury watchmaking. Designed by Gérald Genta, its exterior raised steel to a status equalling that of gold. The eight hexagonal screws displayed on the octagonal bezel – attributes previously unimaginable in the realm of Haute Horlogerie – expressed the robustness of a case containing a mechanical masterpiece: Calibre 2121, the world’s thinnest selfwinding movement with a central rotor. Extremely difficult to produce and decorate, the first Royal Oak was sold at the same price as the gold watches of its time. Against all odds, it met with an enthusiastic response as soon as it was launched on April 15, 1972. At the end of the same year, it was already Audemars Piguet’s most successful single model since the company founding in 1875, with 490 timepieces sold in less than eight months. It is worth recalling that the company in Le Brassus employed less than 100 people at the time to produce a few thousand watches, most of which were issued in very small series averaging 25 units, or even as one-offs. Little by little, the Royal Oak won over a number of active clients who invented faster, more dynamic and versatile lifestyles, combining sportiness with elegance. Although sales grew steadily over the next four years, the Royal Oak remained a kind of UFO at Audemars Piguet, a free spirit, an enfant terrible or a child prodigy... correspondingly difficult to handle. Then at the helm of Audemars Piguet, Georges Golay understood that the Royal Oak could well change the company’s destiny and strongly influence the brand image. While actively supporting the Royal Oak, he expressed his doubts while the model was being designed by Gérald Genta. The latter often told others about these doubts, which he interpreted as resistance. In 1982, the magazine Business &amp; Finance questioned Georges Golay regarding the impact of the Royal Oak on brand image, as this watch featured an unconventional aesthetic, in sharp contrast to the Audemars Piguet collections of the time. Although he was delighted with the contribution of the Royal Oak, he pointed out: &quot;We do not want our name to be projected to the public only through this star model.” Is this the reason why variations of the Royal Oak did not appear until 1976? While there is no such specific indication in the sources, the figures show that Audemars Piguet was careful not to bet everything on the new model. Between 1972 and 1976, the Royal Oak never accounted for more than 7% of the watches produced by the company, nor 6% of the turnover. This is perhaps why some stakeholders of the period perceived it as a commercial failure. As for the advertising campaigns, most of them continued to highlight models that were skeletonised, feminine, oval-shaped or gemset, to name a few. Records and testimonies do not reveal who, when or how the idea for the first ladies’ Royal Oak, Model 8638, originally named &quot;Royal Oak II&quot;, came about. What is certain is that the origins of the project date back to well before its introduction. A sketch dated 1973 reveals a first version, followed in 1974 by the first production plans. It was not until the arrival of Audemars Piguet’s first female designer, Jacqueline Dimier, that the project was completed in 1976. As radical, if not more so than the 1972 Model 5402, the 1976 Model 8638 was also made of steel, with visible screws and a miniature selfwinding mechanism. While the narrowing of its diameter from 39 mm to 29 mm made it even more difficult to produce, the model was a success right from the time of its launch. In 1976, 423 examples were sold; the following year, 756 left Le Brassus and the figure rose to almost 1,000 units in 1978 and exceeded this threshold in 1979. While the Royal Oak broke the rules of fine watchmaking in 1972, its 1976 feminine variant demonstrated that it was capable of breaking its own codes. From then on, designers’ imagination would be given increasingly freer rein. The real turning point came in 1977. Audemars Piguet simultaneously introduced the 5402 and 8638 models in yellow gold, white gold and a combination of steel and yellow gold. At the same time, the brand added a 35 mm intermediate size, Model 4100. From then on, and in barely five years (1977–1981), 27 new Royal Oak references were created. Available in numerous sizes, for men and women, they were gemset, equipped with a variety of dials, sometimes without the Tapisserie motif, and powered by seven different movements, some of which were quartz. Some references even reinterpreted the Royal Oak in the form of pocket watches! Designed by Jacqueline Dimier, Model 4100 sometimes appears in the sources under the name &quot;Royal Oak III”. This model responds to growing demand in certain markets where the first 39 mm Royal Oak had not proved very popular. It should be remembered that although Audemars Piguet's Italian agent, Carlo de Marchi, was one of the Royal Oak instigators in 1970, Italy did not welcome this model with the expected enthusiasm. Its designer Gérald Genta explained in an interview with Audemars Piguet in 2012: &quot;The big cause of drama was the size of the watch, which was elephant-like compared to what people were wearing at that time, with Italian men favouring the Ladymatic. We came along with something so huge that it was simply not possible!” It should be remembered that this 39 mm diameter, which earned it the nickname Royal Oak “Jumbo”, was probably not part of Genta's specifications. It results from the architecture of the Royal Oak case, and more particularly from its eight visible screws framing its Calibre 2121, with its 12 ½-ligne (28 mm) diameter. A smaller movement was needed in order to reduce this diameter. Launched in 1977 under Reference 900, Calibre 2123 was manufactured at the time by LeCoultre &amp; Cie, a factory located a stone's throw from Le Brassus, and with which Audemars Piguet had forged decades-long commercial, technical, friendly and even family ties. This movement differed from its cousin and predecessor 2121 by its smaller diameter (11½ lignes, i.e. 26 mm); its larger thickness (3.25 mm rather than 3.05 mm) enabling the addition of a central seconds hand; and its high frequency (28,800 vph as opposed to 19,800 vph) ensuring enhanced accuracy. The case was redesigned and structured in three parts to maximise the use of the interior space, unlike the &quot;monocoque&quot; system of Model 5402. The space previously taken up by Model 5402's huge gasket was occupied by a bezel featuring a redesigned structure. These transformations enabled watchmakers to reduce the case size by 4 mm, despite the movement being only 2 mm smaller in diameter! The new Royal Oak therefore measured only 35 mm. Audemars Piguet turned to its best partners to produce this model. Italian company Fontana drew up the case plans in November 1976. Later renamed Lascor, this specialised manufacturer was based near Lake Maggiore, in Sesto Calende. Gay Frères supplied bracelet numbered 477 and the Geneva specialist Stern Frères was responsible for the dials adorned with the T21 Tapisserie motif, just as it had been for the previous Royal Oak models. In 1977, Audemars Piguet launched the production of just over 1,000 Royal Oak 4100 watches. Supported by a beautiful advertising campaign, the model found its audience as 472 watches were sold during the launch year. 1978 saw a tidal wave with 1,597 watches sold, followed by 1737 in 1979. In all, no less than 5,720 Model 4100 watches were sold, taking the Royal Oak into a new dimension. Even more than Model 8638, the Royal Oak 4100 demonstrated that the enfant terrible was capable of evolving, mellowing and being transformed. More than 75% of these watches contain gold; all of them measure 35 mm in diameter and feature the “AP” monogram at 12 o'clock; none are ultra-thin. Thanks to these new codes, Italy finally began to adopt the Royal Oak. While only 4% of Model 5402 had been distributed there, this country absorbed 1,379 watches numbered 4100 and 8638, i.e. more than 15% of the total production. Raymond Bornand – who was in charge of the Royal Oak distribution in Switzerland at the time – loves to point out that many Italian men opted to wear the 29 mm Model 8638. In the end, two thirds of the models were made entirely or partially of gold. The future of the Royal Oak was to be built on these new aesthetic codes. Model 4100 is referred to in the archives as &quot;Royal Oak III.&quot; No &quot;IV&quot; version exists due to the increasing number of variations from that point on. While there were many different sizes, the 35 mm diameter asserted itself as the new benchmark for men’s watches. From 1978 to 1982, several variants of Model 4100 were created using Calibre 2123 (26 mm in diameter, 3.25 thick), notably to accommodate precious stones: 4153 (1978); 4275 (1981); 4287; (1981); 4331 (1982). From 1986–87, the 35 mm models were equipped with a smaller mechanism, Calibre 2131 (23.3 mm in diameter, 3.2 mm thick, Frédéric Piguet blank), notably Models 14544 (1987); 14486 (1990); 14575 (1990) and 14674 (1990). From 1983 onwards, there were further shifts. The majority of models were upsized to 36 mm, starting with the Royal Oak 4332 (calendar models 5572, 5581, 5658, 5577, 5595, 25594...) and then the 14700 line from 1990. Over the next two decades, more than 50 Royal Oak models with a 36 mm diameter were produced. Most were equipped with Calibre 2125 and its derivatives including Calibre 2225, a family of selfwinding movements created in the 1970s by LeCoultre &amp; Cie. These veritable tracteurs (tractors) – a term used by watchmakers to designate a robust movement capable of accommodating complications – equipped countless models until the 21st century. The first Royal Oak watches with complications appeared in 1983. Their 36 mm diameter confirmed the new sizing standard.  Audemars Piguet first presented the Royal Oak Day Date, Model 5572, equipped with Calibre 2124\u002F2810 (26 mm in diameter, 4.55 mm thick), followed by several derivatives numbered 5577, 5581 and 5584. The base movement blank was produced by Jaeger-LeCoultre, while the calendar plate was manufactured by Dubois Dépraz in the small village of Le Lieu in the Vallée de Joux. The development was carried out in Audemars Piguet's brand-new Technical Department, as evidenced by plans dating from 1982. The same applies to the Royal Oak triple calendar models equipped with Calibre 2124\u002F2825, housed in a case identical to the first Day Date model. They were also available in several variants featuring a moon phase from 1983 onwards: 5658, 5595, 25594 and 25627.  This 36 mm diameter was used again ten years later for the first Royal Oak Dual Time, whose time-zone system was based on Audemars Piguet patent CH673196A. Equipped with Calibre 2129\u002F2845 (26 mm in diameter, 4.85 mm thick), the first variations bore model numbers 25744, 25762, 25772 and 25730. They were followed by Models 25757 and 25929, both powered by Calibre 2229\u002F2845. Finally, the Royal Oak with annual calendar (Model 25920, Calibre 2224\u002F2814) adopted the same size in 1999. Whether in music, art, cuisine or design, a great classic is a celebrated, well-known, admired and respected work that can be endlessly reinterpreted. Unchanging, yet constantly renewed, the Royal Oak began to meet this definition in the 1980s. Certain elements remained immutable: the octagonal bezel punctuated by eight screws, the tonneau-shaped case with two bevels, the tapering metal bracelet. But from then on, sizes became increasingly varied and materials more diverse. In 1979, the Royal Oak welcomed its first diamonds. The discerning eye will note that the stones are set around the rim of the bezel, creating a refined sparkling effect that does not compete with the screws. Above and beyond aesthetic considerations, the reason behind this was technical. The bezels of ultra-thin Model 5402 are hollowed out to better hold the oversized gasket. They were therefore too thin to be gemset on top. In an interview given in 2020, Raymond Bornand, who was in charge of Audemars Piguet’s distribution in Switzerland between 1973 and the 2000s, tells of having the first Royal Oak set at an independent jeweller. He then presented it to the workshops in Le Brassus, which adopted the gemsetting and endlessly reinterpreted it thereafter.  More and more liberties were taken with the dial from 1977 onwards. Colours were varied to match those of the gold case, while the Tapisserie motif sometimes vanished, whether on Model 4100 versions or on the ladies' variants. Jacques-Louis Audemars and Georges Golay hesitated for a long time before bringing the Royal Oak into the quartz era. While they finally took this step in 1978, they did so in a cautious manner typical of the Vallée de Joux mindset, as this topic was extremely sensitive and explosive at the time. Coupled with a decade of global economic, financial and oil crises, the flood of Japanese, American and then Chinese quartz watches severely affected Swiss watchmaking, plunging the entire sector into the most serious crisis in its history since 1974, and almost wiping out the entire industry.  Like all watchmakers, Audemars Piguet had to make choices. On the one hand, its history, its highly qualified watchmakers, its deep-rooted identity and its convictions naturally inclined it to defend traditional expertise against all odds. On the other hand, its curiosity about the present and the future, its attachment to innovation and its perception of the danger of missing its chance dictated that it should adopt new technology – or at least try its hand in this field The Manufacture therefore took an early interest in quartz. In 1969, it signed an agreement with the SSIH, primarily aimed at promoting the distribution of Audemars Piguet watches. In actual fact, however, the brand also began working discreetly with the Swiss watchmaking giant on a quartz watch project. Five years of development were necessary before Model 6001, designed by Jean-Fred Meylan, was presented in 1974. Its generously sized case housed the voluminous Calibre 2510 (31x25 mm in diameter, 6 mm thick). This distillation of high-tech sophistication named &quot;megaquartz&quot; boasted extraordinary precision with a tolerance standard of only one second per month. Its resonator vibrated at a rate of 2,359,296 times per second, compared to four times for a high-frequency mechanical watch. The movement equipped just over 350 Audemars Piguet watches between 1974 (59 that year) and 1978.  Despite this amazing performance, it was clear even during the 1970s that the long-term durability of these “mechanisms” was not guaranteed. Not only was technology evolving at high speed, making systems, components, batteries and other printed circuits obsolete after a few years, but electronics was very different from traditional mechanical horology in terms of production methods, components, materials, skills, expertise, etc. Watchmakers meticulously decorated each part with the utmost care, but should they become electronic engineers? Could the Royal Oak speak the language of quartz? Should it? This revolutionary model had in its own way offered an alternative to quartz: a watch whose radically futuristic design and transgressive spirit were dedicated to serving traditional expertise (hand finishing of steel, the world's thinnest selfwinding movement, etc).  In a memoir written in 2006, Jacqueline Dimier explained: &quot;The temptation to introduce quartz in the Royal Oak line was great, but the management was opposed to it and instead created a related line, ref. 6005, that was rectangular with bevelled edge. It had the same bracelet and suitable finishing, but to set itself apart, the screws were replaced by four studs.” The solution chosen by Jacques-Louis Audemars and Georges Golay represents the quintessential balancing act. The two men had set themselves the objective of sparing the so-called &quot;classic&quot; collections – round or oval, including many variations equipped with ultra-thin Calibre 2003 – from quartz for as long as possible. While they also wanted to preserve their brand-new Royal Oak icon, they sensed that its transgressive character lent itself better to the irruption of disruptive technology. By creating a &quot;related line,&quot; they achieved a successful compromise – at least for the time being. The technical specifications for the case of the first Royal Oak quartz men's watch indicate that Model 6005 (1978) was equipped with Calibre 2511, developed from 1972 onwards. With a diameter of 23.2 mm, it was much smaller than its predecessor, Calibre 2510, yet its 3.5 mm thickness was still fairly substantial. At that point in time, quartz was already no longer perceived as the height of technology and the future of luxury. It was therefore necessary to dispel any doubts regarding the value of the mechanism. A historical &quot;Notice du rhabilleur AP&quot; (note from the AP repairer) deemed it necessary to indicate: &quot;Quartz movement finished by the master-watchmakers of Audemars Piguet and Cie in the finest Haute Horlogerie tradition&quot;. This argument also appeared in the advertising campaigns supporting the launch of the watch: &quot;It is a quartz, no doubt, but it is above all an Audemars Piguet (...) And only Audemars Piguet, thanks to its total mastery of watchmaking forms and techniques, was able to give its letters of nobility to electronics.&quot; In 1980, another advertisement introduced this watch as &quot;The acceptable face of innovation.&quot;  But is this watch a Royal Oak? Its bezel is neither octagonal nor punctuated by eight hexagonal screws. Printed sources provide the answer to this question. In the catalogues dated 1978 – 1979 and beyond, Model 6005 is never called a Royal Oak, but simply &quot;Quartz.&quot; In 1981, the range was extended with seven models of the same nature (6005, 6009, 6010, 6015, 6014, 6026 and 6028) through 14 variants, ten of which were equipped with Calibre 2502 (17.5 x 13.5 x 1.98 mm). Once again, the name Royal Oak does not appear. These watches were referred to as the &quot;AP Quartz Line,&quot; which continued until at least 1985. They were therefore not Royal Oak watches, but &quot;close relatives,&quot; to use Jacqueline Dimier's expression. It was thus with great reluctance that Audemars Piguet brought quartz into the history of the Royal Oak. After the above-mentioned trial run, the company decided to take a further step in response to pressing market demand. In 1980, three &quot;real&quot; Royal Oak models were fitted with quartz Calibre 2502. This microelectronic marvel developed by Jaeger-LeCoultre was distinguished by its modest 17.2 x 13.5 x 1.98 mm measurements making it possible to introduce two new sizes.  In three years, the Royal Oak 30 mm was produced as five different models (6008 and 6013 in 1980, 6020 in 1981, 6033 and 6035 in 1982). The even smaller Royal Oak 26 mm heralded the “Mini Royal Oak” chapter, the first models of which (6012 in 1980; 6007 and 6019 in 1981 and 6027 and 6034 in 1982) prefigured the 20 mm Royal Oak introduced in 1997 (Model 67075). These variations were all dedicated to women. From then on, most of ladies’ Royal Oak watches were equipped with a quartz movement. Between 1982 and 1985, the number of quartz movements and the variations in size increased. The 26 mm Royal Oak watches were now equipped with the even thinner Calibre 2508 (17.2 x 13.5 mm x 1.6 mm) and welcomed the new Model 6131. The 31 mm variants housed the new Calibre 2711 (17.2 mm in diameter, 2.5 mm thick, Girard Perregaux blank). More importantly, a new, more generous size of 35 mm in diameter appeared, which for the first time was identical to that of certain mechanical models. In 1982, Calibre 2506 was already fitted in several 35 mm models (56023, 56036, 56037, 56038, 56039, 56040), as quartz and mechanics crossed paths. For the first time, customers could choose between almost identical watches, some of which were quartz and others mechanical. The first electronic variants often bore the indication &quot;quartz&quot; on their dials, and Audemars Piguet watchmakers made a point of adorning the metal components with the same care as the mechanical movements. An overview of 1980s production records makes it clear that the first generations of Royal Oak quartz watches made up a significant part of Audemars Piguet production in the 1980s. In ten years, at least 59 models were created, equipped with six different quartz movements: 2502, 2505 (26 mm in diameter, 3.15 mm thick), 2506 (26 mm in diameter, 3.15 mm thick), 2508, ultra-thin 2610 (16.2 mm in diameter, 1.9 mm thick) and 2711. Of these, 44 were set with precious stones, whether on the case, the dial, or both. More generally, the proportion of Audemars Piguet quartz watches rose from 7% in 1979 to 30% the following year. In 1986, it reached an all-time high: half of all watches were equipped with quartz movements. From then on, this proportion decreased regularly. Ten years later, only 20% of watches were quartz-driven.  This quartz boom met strong demand from markets keen on novelty. It should not however obscure the fact that, at the same time, Audemars Piguet played a central role in the revival of classic complications, which were fitted not only on round and pocket watches, but also on the Royal Oak collection. The perpetual calendar was introduced in the Royal Oak collection (Model 5554, followed by 25636 in 1986, 25654 in 1987, 25729 in 1992, etc.) as early as 1984. In 1997, for its 25th anniversary, the octagonal watch adopted the chronograph (Calibre 2385, Models 25850 and 25865, then Model 26320 in 2012, etc.), but also the tourbillon (Model 25831, Calibre 2875; then Model 26355, Calibre 2886 in 2010; Model 26510, Calibre 2924 in 2012, etc.) and even the Grande Complication (Calibre 2885, models 25865 in 1997, then 25953 in 2001, etc.) In the 2000s, the equation of time was introduced (Calibre 2121\u002F2808, Model 26603 from 2008), shortly after the double tourbillon-chronograph complications (Tradition d'Excellence Model 25969, Calibre 2893; Model 25977, Calibre 2889 in 2003; Model 26039 in 2004; Model 26355, Calibre 2886 in 2010, etc.). The radical concept of Model 5402 from 1972, left untouched for four years, could never have led us to guess the fate of the Royal Oak. By opening up to women and then to precious materials, new dimensions, gemsetting, complications and quartz movements, the Royal Oak revealed an adaptability that was as unexpected as it was extraordinary. The aesthetics designed by Genta have been constantly reinterpreted since 1976, giving rise not only to a rich and lively collection, but also to two additional collections, each with its own strong identity: the Royal Oak Offshore from 1993 and the Royal Oak Concept from 2002. In 2022, the Royal Oak alone accounts for more than 550 different models, most of which have been produced in multiple variants. If we add the two related collections, this figure amounts to almost 850 models!

It was the first Royal Oak to be equipped with a centre seconds hand, and its aim was to win over a clientele that considered the 5402 (39 mm) to be too large, particularly in Italy, the United States and Asia. The 4100 set the standards with a diameter of 35 mm. Right from its introduction, it was available in steel, yellow gold and two-tone versions. The majority of the models were equipped with Calibre 2123, but some of the later creations were powered by Calibre 2125 and others by Calibre 2124. From 1982 onwards, at least 96 watches had their mechanical calibre replaced by quartz Calibre 2506, which was originally fitted in at least 36 watches. More than 8,400 were produced between 1977 and 1985 and sold until 2002. Models derived from the 4100: 4120 (1978, probably never produced), 4153 (1978), 4275 (1982), 4287 (1982), 4331 (1982).   Royal Oak 4100With its steel casing and Tapisserie T21 dial, the 4100ST reinterprets the original codes of Model 5402 while adding a seconds hand. The Audemars Piguet press kit for the 1978 Basel Fair announced that this 35 mm model was designed &quot;for small wrists&quot;. Sales from 1977 to 1987: 2,721 units in all, of which 192 (1977), 741 (1978), 494 (1979), 387 (1980), 618 (1981), 188 (1982), 71 (1983), 17 (1984), 8 (1985), 2 (1986), 3 (1987). Royal Oak 4100STThe bezel, studs, hands and hour-markers are in 3N yellow gold. The slate grey dial echoes the colour of the steel case and links. The Royal Oak 4100SA number 1 remained a presentation model. Number 2 was sold in 1980. It is therefore number 3 that was sold first on June 9, 1977. Sales from 1977 to 2002: 3,563 units in all, of which 192 (1977), 479 (1978), 853 (1979), 783 (1980), 818 (1981), 250 (1982), 123 (1983), 41 (1984), 12 (1985), 3 (1986), 5 (1987-2002).

Royal Oak 4100BAThe white gold version of Model 4100 appeared in 1981, four years after the introduction of the other materials. Its production was so restricted that the watch was neither included in any Audemars Piguet catalogue, nor photographed for identification upon release.

This new mechanism, which oscillated at a high frequency of 28,800 vph, was both 2 mm smaller and 0.2 mm thicker than its predecessor, thus enabling it to add a centre seconds hand, a first for a Royal Oak watch. Just under 9,000 units were produced between 1977 and 1984, the most productive years being 1987–1981 with an annual average of around 1,800 movements. Major improvements were made in 1979, leading to the creation of the 2123\u002F1 variation (different mainplate, new pull-out piece, barrel bridge, yoke spring, etc.). Calibre 2123 heralded the long history of Audemars Piguet 11½-ligne (26 mm) selfwinding calibres based on a LeCoultre &amp; Cie blank. In 1983, the second generation kicked off with Calibre 2124, followed by its derivatives 2124\u002F2810, 2124\u002F2815, 2124\u002F2825, 2124\u002F2812, 2125, 2126, 2126\u002F2840 and 2129\u002F2845. The third generation was born in 1996 with Calibre 2224, also accompanied by multiple derivatives 2224\u002F2810, 2224\u002F2815, 2224\u002F2811, 2224\u002F2812, 2224\u002F2814, 2225, 2226, 2226\u002F2840, 2226\u002F2841, 2226\u002F2839, 2127\u002F2827, 2229\u002F2845.

However, the most prestigious brands, such as Patek Philippe, Vacheron Constantin and Audemars Piguet, had almost never made steel watches. These three companies, often referred to as the watch industry &quot;triumvirate” because they were so prominent at the time, worked mostly with gold and platinum. Their rare steel creations were produced in extremely modest quantities: between 1934 and 1962, Audemars Piguet crafted 52 chronograph wristwatches, almost all unique (see Audemars Piguet 20th Century Complicated Wristwatches). Another example is the selfwinding Model 5281ST produced in the early 1960s (illustration). The fact that the Royal Oak broke every Haute Horlogerie rule in the book back in 1972 was not so much because of its material as its price. The extreme complexity of its steel exterior, endowed with prestigious finishes, placed it on a par with gold watches. The Royal Oak bridged the gap between two previously opposing worlds: craftsmanship and sport. It was aimed at a new generation that wanted a watch suited to a modern, versatile and faster-paced lifestyle. The concept was both radical and transgressive. It profoundly altered the status of steel, which became a noble material thanks to the work of the finest artisans and the fact that it was built into the watch design right from the outset, rather than being merely a variation. The success of the Royal Oak marked a milestone and carved a path that other players in the world of Haute Horlogerie would soon follow. Presented in 1976 by Patek Philippe, the Nautilus was supported by a campaign whose arguments echoed those accompanying the success of the Royal Oak 5402 (pictured). The Geneva-based Manufacture announced: &quot;One of the world’s costliest watches is made of steel&quot;. It went on to stress that the value lay in the craftsmanship applied to steel, before concluding with the modernity of a watch made for both formal and informal occasions. For Audemars Piguet, the time had come to begin the next chapter and to treat the Royal Oak’s “armour” to a variety of materials. In 1977, the Earth’s population had just passed the four billion-mark. The first Star Wars movie was a box-office hit and John Travolta was dancing his heart out in Saturday Night Fever. In the small village of Le Brassus, Audemars Piguet’s founding families were playing a more active role than ever in the development of the brand. Already 87 years old by then, Paul Edward Piguet (1890 – 1979) – son of company co-founder Edward Auguste Piguet (1851 – 1918) – daily drove to the workshops on his moped to keep up with everything that was going on. Jacques-Louis Audemars (1910 – 2002) represented the third generation of the Audemars family since his grandfather, the other co-founder Jules Louis Audemars. He was in charge of technical and creative activities, while executive management had for the previous decade been in the hands of Georges Golay. Audemars Piguet had 130 employees at the time, most of whom were involved in developing and producing nearly 9,000 watches per year. Three people were in charge of sales: Martin K. Wehrli, future Director of the Audemars Piguet Museum; Stephen Urquhart, future joint Managing Director of AP (and subsequently President &amp; CEO of Omega); and the young Jean-Claude Biver, who was making his first forays into watchmaking and whose experience at Audemars Piguet would enable him to play a central role in the development of Blancpain, Omega, Hublot and the other watch brands of the LVMH group. Audemars Piguet's turnover had just topped CHF 26 million, representing five times more than ten years previously. Despite the global economic upheavals and the watchmaking crisis that was wiping out entire swathes of the industry, the company was making steady progress. As for the Royal Oak, even though it represented less than ten percent of the brand's turnover, the watch industry’s enfant terrible had acquired a fine reputation. Having demonstrated the value of steel, Audemars Piguet decided to give in to market demands and create Royal Oak watches in gold. This decision was reminiscent of the first Royal Oak prototypes which had already been designed in white gold. It may seem surprising that the first Royal Oak prototypes were made in gold in 1970, whereas steel was already a fundamental element of this model in 1972 (see the article on the birth of the Royal Oak). The reason is twofold. On the one hand, Georges Golay had entrusted production of the case to Favre-Perret, which had never worked with steel and which needed time to adapt its traditional expertise to this material, which is much harder than gold and platinum. On the other hand, the case structure was unprecedented and posed a major challenge in terms of water resistance. In June 1970, the four prototypes numbered from 60646 to 60649 and ordered by Gérald Genta were made of white gold. At least two were melted down and only one was fitted with a movement, for a prestigious customer. Prototype No. 60647, bearing small number 101 and equipped with movement 127230 was sold to Vacheron Constantin on July 6, 1972. Verbal sources close to the Iranian court suggest that this watch was intended for Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who is said to have previewed a white gold prototype and ordered a model of this kind, on condition that it remained in white gold. Audemars Piguet is said to have bent the rules and assembled this single example. Since the 1950s, Vacheron Constantin had been distributing the Audemars Piguet brand and enjoyed good relations with the Shah's court. In addition, the Audemars Piguet archives mention a special order for dial 5402, dated September 28, 1972, for a single dial with the initials &quot;MRP&quot; (probably standing for Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) on the 12 o’clock hour-marker, suggesting that the Shah wanted to personalise his watch. In 1980, it returned to Switzerland via Jean-Pierre Cottier, a famous lawyer from the princely and royal courts. Badly damaged (it is said that the Shah tested the watch in his swimming pool), case no. 60647 was then destroyed and replaced by no. B34438. The white gold prototype assembled especially for the Shah of Iran is therefore an exception, as it was not until 1977 that gold officially entered the collection. Whose idea was it to introduce gold into the Royal Oak collection? A study of the sources reveals several possible origins. Gérald Genta, the designer of the Royal Oak, had been wearing the Royal Oak 5402 no. A175 on his wrist since September 1972. At that time, he had distanced himself from Audemars Piguet, notably because he had just founded his own watch brand. In a recorded interview given in 2011, the man whom Asian collectors had nicknamed the &quot;Picasso of Watches&quot; tells how he replaced the bezel of his steel Royal Oak with yellow gold at a very early stage: &quot;The Royal Oak I usually wear is in steel with a gold bezel. Georges Golay didn't know about this gold bezel, but I made one for Les Ambassadeurs [Editor’s Note: the famous Geneva retailer].” Genta explains that the latter had delivered 20 steel Royal Oak watches to him and that he had made gold bezels in his own workshops before reselling the transformed watches to Les Ambassadeurs for the retailer to market in the United States. Gérald Genta adds: &quot;…because it is obvious that America at that time could not bear a watch that was any other colour than yellow.” For many regions of the world, including the United States, yellow gold was indeed long considered as THE metal for Haute Horlogerie watches. The Audemars Piguet archives contain the manuscript of an unpublished book written by a certain Edgar Barry between 1993 and 1995 and devoted to the history of the Royal Oak. This document relates that the idea of a two-tone Royal Oak was born during a discussion between the Parisian jeweller Fred and Georges Golay on a sunny terrace in the south of France: &quot;It was the kind of day which makes you feel that all is right with the world. And Fred, perhaps seeing a reflection of the sun on Golay's Royal Oak, said: ‘Why don't you do a version with a band of gold – mix the stainless steel and gold together?’” In 1977, Jean-Claude Biver was responsible for the Swiss, German and Italian markets. In an interview from 2021, he explains more prosaically that the success of the Royal Oak in steel naturally inspired its variations in precious materials: &quot;It was an obvious choice.” The archives do not enable us to decide which of these three versions is the most accurate. No doubt all three were combined to produce the gold variations of the Royal Oak. Nonetheless, a close examination of the records reveals an unexpected fact: the first variations appeared not on the legendary Model 5402, but on the first women’s Royal Oak, Model 8638. Watches with exteriors featuring several metal colours have appeared since the Renaissance. Associating different shades enriched the ornamentation and various colours in the form of enamels, pearls or gems were sometimes added. During the Art Deco years, Audemars Piguet continued this tradition by combining gold and platinum, sometimes adding rubies, emeralds or coloured dials. In the field of Haute Horlogerie, on the other hand, it is infinitely rarer for a watch to combine gold and steel. This pairing was doubtless perceived as an alliance between the noble and the prosaic, the aristocratic and the mundane. At Audemars Piguet, a few rare examples appeared during World War II, in particular the Pre-Model 1533 chronograph, whose 18-carat pink gold bezel was teamed with a steel case middle (and which inspired the Model [Re]master01 26595SR presented in 2020 on the occasion of the opening of the Musée Atelier Audemars Piguet). One oral tradition explains the choice of steel by the shortage of gold during the conflict. Another justifies it by the customs restrictions on trade in precious metals, particularly with Italy. Nevertheless, this case is exceptional and after the war, several bimetallic examples of similar watches were re-cased-up entirely in gold. The first Royal Oak combining gold and steel was made for women. Model 8638SA (the &quot;SA&quot; code is a contraction of &quot;ST&quot; for steel and &quot;BA&quot; for yellow gold), bearing case number 14103, left Le Brassus on February 23, 1977 for the Swiss market, followed the next day by two identical watches – one destined for Italy and the other for New York. Three months later Model 5402SA made its debut. These two Royal Oak examples are among the first in history to associate steel with gold, on both case and bracelet, a combination which enriches the light effects with contrasting colours. Jacqueline Dimier designed these timepieces like paintings. The background was uniformly grey: from the bracelet to the case middle, slate grey T21 Tapisserie dial and crown. The gold components stood out, strongly highlighting their most salient features. The yellow gold bezel gave structure to the watch and framed the dial which was also enhanced by hands, hour-markers and the AP monogram, all crafted in yellow gold. Similarly, the bracelet featured gold studs adding further yellow accents. From then on, the so-called &quot;two-tone&quot; or &quot;bimetallic&quot; Royal Oak watches were all to adopt this same principle. The bezel, studs and hour-markers\u002Fhands were interpreted in the same material (or the same colour) – whether steel, gold, platinum, titanium or tantalum – while a second material was reserved for the case middle, bracelet links and crown. In the space of 50 years, dozens of different combinations have been created. Among them are the &quot;AC&quot; with a yellow gold case and a white gold bezel, the &quot;SP&quot; which marries steel and platinum, the &quot;TR&quot; which unites tantalum and pink gold, and the &quot;IP&quot; titanium and platinum versions, etc. These codes are described in detail in the article dedicated to Audemars Piguet watch numbering. In the 1970s and 1980s, yellow gold dominated the world of luxury watches and the &quot;metal of kings&quot; was the focus of attention. The end of the gold standard and the financial crises caused its price to soar, resulting in supply problems for some watchmakers and a significant rise in prices for customers. So much so that several associations launched campaigns to promote gold watches, including a company named Intergold and the Association pour la promotion industrielle de l’or (APRIOR, Association for the Industrial Promotion of Gold). When considered in this context, the first Royal Oak in yellow gold (BA) takes on a special meaning, especially when one knows that the case of a Model 4100 weighs over 100 grams of gold. Like the two-tone variations, the women's Model 8638BA got the ball rolling and the first models were delivered in March 1977, followed in June that same year by the first Models 5402BA and 4100BA. Until that point, each Royal Oak model had been available with one dial only. With the introduction of yellow gold, several variations on the same model became available. Some dials were Bleu Nuit, Nuage 50 while others were gold-toned. In this respect, the Stern archives use the name &quot;Brun Nuage 21&quot;. Their gold hour-markers adopted the same colour as the case, as did the hands, some of which were tritium-free for the first time, most often on the gemset variations. On some dials, the hour-markers were replaced by diamonds, particularly on the variations set around the edge of the bezel (see for example Models 4187, 4275, 4153). As for white gold models (bearing the BC code), apart from the Shah's Royal Oak, the first 5402BC watch was sold in 1977. It was the only white gold Royal Oak to leave the workshops that year, in December. Fifty more were produced the following year. In November 1978, it was Model 8638 that appeared attired in white gold for the first time, and it was not until October 1981 that Model 4100 was adorned with the same metal. Between 1972 and 1976, Royal Oak advertising relied heavily on the steel argument. The ads featured terms such as: &quot;tribute to steel&quot;, &quot;metal of the 20th century&quot;, &quot;finest of steel&quot;, or &quot;men of steel.&quot; The announcement was made that &quot;the gold watch has found its rival in steel.&quot; Expressions abounded: &quot;luxus in Stahl&quot;, &quot;the most intractable of materials&quot;, &quot;steel now a noble metal.&quot; Some ads asked: &quot;What makes steel more valuable than gold?&quot; and promoted &quot;functional steel brought to its highest degree of refinement&quot;, because &quot;materials alone do not make a masterpiece.&quot; The introduction of gold in 1977 required a change in the sales pitch. The Heinz Heimann advertising agency, which took over from Hugo Buchser in 1975, managed the transition brilliantly. In 1977, steel was presented as the “starting point of a range of thoroughbred watches.&quot; The focus was on the bezel: &quot;The entire world knows the distinctive bezel held with eight miniature screws.&quot; Thus, even in its new diversity, &quot;the Royal Oak remains unique and exclusive. Through its satin finish, its audacious lines, by the perfection of its movement, it is coveted by those who know that the summum of watchmaking is a subtle alliance of technology and art.&quot; As early as 1978, some adverts featured stories mingling humour with watchmaking messages. One of the most successful of these drew attention to the visible screws. As transgressive and innovative as steel itself, the screws became the focus of debate. In one scenario, two friends are leaning against a rail: &quot;A price like that&quot;, he teased, &quot;and they don’t conceal the screws?” A discussion ensues highlighting the watch's qualities, its character and its history. In 1977, 188 Royal Oak Model 5402 watches with all or partially gold exteriors were delivered worldwide. Half were in yellow gold, the other half in two-tone gold and only one in white gold. The following year, 580 watches were delivered, then 347 in 1979, 264 in 1980, 182 in 1981, 64 in 1982. It took 20 years to sell the next 136. A total of 876 two-tone Model 5402SA watches were sold, 736 in yellow gold Model 5402BA and 150 in white gold Model 5402BC. Figures for the various markets confirm Gérald Genta's claim that the American market associated luxury with yellow gold. Until 1977, the United States had distributed barely 8% of the Royal Oak watches sold to date. The year gold was launched, they ordered one-third of the new models. At the same time, the Royal Oak 5402 was gradually making inroads in Asia, a continent that was also particularly keen on traditional noble materials. The situation was different in Italy. In ten years, only six 5402 watches in gold were sold there! Appearances can however be deceptive, as Italy gave an exceptional welcome to the Royal Oak II (29 mm) and III (35 mm) gold and two-tone versions. It was in their smaller, usually gold, cases that the Royal Oak models conquered the world's fashion capital, where the idea for the first Royal Oak was born. Oral sources inform us of longstanding market demand for precious metal interpretations of the Royal Oak. An analysis of sales shows that the requests were well founded and that gold was expected by customers. In 1977, 17% of Royal Oak watches came in gold or two-tone versions. The following year, that percentage rose to over 61% and in 1979, it passed the 72% mark. From that point on, nearly three-quarters of Royal Oak watches were partially or entirely made of gold! The operation was a twofold success. Not only did gold make its presence felt, but the number of Royal Oak watches sold increased rapidly. In 1976, Audemars Piguet delivered a total of 1,009 Royal Oaks, all in steel. The following year, thanks to the launch of Model 4100 and the integration of gold into Models 5402 and 8638, this figure almost doubled to 1,926 watches. In 1979, more than 3,500 Royal Oak watches with mechanical movements left the Le Brassus workshops – to which must be added the quartz versions, which were enjoying a major boom at the time. On the scale of Audemars Piguet back then, this was a veritable tidal wave. While some purists had feared that attiring the Royal Oak in gold would weaken it, the reality of the operation definitively removed any doubts. At the dawn of the 1980s, all hopes were justified... the enfant terrible of watchmaking had become a collection full of promise.

This type of gemsetting corresponds to the first generations of gemset Royal Oak watches. It can be explained by the thinness of the bezels which made it difficult to set on the top without jeopardising the watch’s water-resistance. It served to emphasise the rounded octagonal shape while highlighting the eight hexagonal screws of the case. 176 units were sold in 1978 and 1985.

Apart from the Royal Oak, several round pocket watches were equipped with this calibre, notably the perpetual calendar Models 5555 and 5559. Between 1979 and 1995, more than 1,000 Calibres 5020 were produced, including more than 300 openworked versions. In 1982, a variation with a perpetual calendar was added, Calibre 5020\u002F2820, of which just under 200 were produced, including about 50 openworked models. This was followed by a starwheel (wandering hours) variation in the mid-1990s.

Calibre 5020 is the successor to the 5017 (IWC blank, ref. 952) from the 1960s–1970s. The 5020 blank came from the workshops of Frédéric Piguet in Le Brassus, a company founded by the famous Louis Elisée Piguet, with whom Audemars Piguet had created exceptional watches as early as the 19th century, in particular the Universelle (1899), which comprised 21 complications. Around 1988, Calibre 5025 added a small seconds hand to the base calibre.

The addition of 64 diamonds (eight per side) changed the reference of the watches to 4187. This particular practice is comparable to the transformation of Model 4100 into the gemset 4153 (1978) or 4275 (1981) variations. While watches change reference, they maintain the small number of their original model (in this instance 5402). Thus, for example, one of the Model 4187BC watches bears the number 134 (from the 5402BC series), although the total production of this reference probably does not exceed 10 pieces. In fact, 4187 watches are included in the Model 5402 register. The first four white gold watches were sold on November 13, 1979. The yellow gold versions followed in January 1980. The model remained in the Audemars Piguet catalogue from 1981 to 1985.

Thirty years later, it was presented at the Antiquorum spring sale in Hong Kong but did not find a buyer. Six months later it was auctioned in the same city by Christie's and finally sold for less than USD 15,000. At that time, neither the world of collectors nor the Audemars Piguet Heritage team in Le Brassus were aware of the watch's rarity, let alone its link with Model 5402.

It was introduced in 1983 to replace Calibre 2123, whose performance it improved, while renouncing high frequency. It plays the role of a base calibre, which means that it is designed to operate alone, but also to accommodate additional mechanisms, called &quot;modules&quot; or “cadratures” in watchmaking parlance. Thus, in the very year of its birth, Calibre 2124 was fitted in models with the 2810 dial (pointer-type day and date display), which was used on the so-called “Owl” Royal Oak Day Date models 5572, 5581, 5584, 25577 (1985) and 26330 (2009). From 1984 onwards, Calibre 2124 was complemented by the 2825 cadrature (day, pointer-type date and moon phase) which equipped the Royal Oak Day Date Moon Phase models 25594 and 25595 in 1984, then 25627 in 1985 and finally 25658 in 1987.  Some Royal Oak models were equipped with Calibre 2124 without an additional cadrature, in particular the Royal Oak 4332 (from 1983), 4100 (25 pieces in 1984–87), 14702 (1991), 14701 (1992) and 14705 (1992). Its most direct derived version is Calibre 2125 (1987–1997), which is not designed to accommodate an additional mechanism but features indirect centre seconds. Its successor is Calibre 2224, which features a high frequency of 28,800 vph (1999–2004 and which notably housed the Starwheel 2811 cadratures), then Calibre 2324 (from 2005 onwards). Between 1983 and 1996, Audemars Piguet acquired 14,650 2124 movement blanks, including: 2,440 (1983), 3,310 (1984), 1,900 (1985), 500 (1986), 700 (1987), 600 (1988), 700 (1989), 300 (1990), 600 (1991), 1,900 (1992), 1,000 (1993), 400 (1994) and 300 (1996). 6,866 examples of Calibre 2124 were fitted in 16 Royal Oak models between 1983 and 1999.

During the 1960s and 1970s, many variations of ultra-thin watches were created in very small series, which were sometimes round in shape, but often polygonal, hexagonal and even octagonal. Model 5691 (renamed 35691 in 1984–85) was the first to interpret the Royal Oak as a pocket watch. The eight non-cross-through hexagonal screws punctuate the bezel as well as the chain links. It is worth noting that the sword-type hands and hour-markers have no luminescent material. The archives mention a launch in 1979, but the Production Registers (Registres d'Etablissage) indicate that the 116 or so of these watches produced were sold between 1980 and 1982. Model 5691 appeared in the Audemars Piguet catalogue in 1981, as did its gemset version, Model 5709. Three other variations also appear in the archives: solid dial 5745 (1981), openworked 5710 (1981) and 5746 (1983). In the 1990s, they were succeeded by a new generation of Royal Oak pocket watches, with a 48 mm diameter. Some models were also equipped with Calibre 5020 (35797, 35798 and 35801) while others were fitted with Calibre 5025 (35796, 35800). Model 25729 (1993) featured an additional perpetual calendar under-dial work. Royal Oak 5691At least 53 watches in the yellow gold version were sold between 1980 and 1981.

In 1983, Model 4332 heralded the grand chapter of the Royal Oak 36 mm (exception Model 14486, introduced in 1986). For 32 years, this size became the core of the collection, interpreted through more than 50 models. Among them, the Royal Oak hour, minute and date, notably Model 14700 (1990), then 14790 (1992) and 14800 (1992), as well as the Royal Oak Day Date 5572 (1983), its version with moon phases 25594 (1984–2005), then Dual Time 25730 (1993), annual calendar 25920 (1999) and numerous gemset variations.

In 1985, the model was renamed 14332 and 248 watches were produced. When in 1986 its successor Model 14486 (35 mm) was introduced, the production dropped to 176 watches, then 30 the following year. A few of them were sold sporadically until 1996. In 1985, each member of the crew of the UBS Switzerland boat, whose spinnaker bore the Royal Oak logo, received a Royal Oak 4332 engraved with &quot;TOUR DU MONDE 85–86&quot;.

Royal Oak 4332Like its predecessor Model 4100, Model 4332 houses a calibre with a 26 mm diameter (11½ lignes). Thanks to the diameter of the new case being enlarged by one millimetre, watchmakers had a little more space inside to ensure the watch's water resistance.

This is at least what can be deduced from the fact that in 1983, a year before its appearance in the catalogue, 606 of them were delivered by the Le Brassus Manufacture. The subsequent gradual decrease in numbers was due to a variant: Model 5594 that was born from Model 5572 and presented in 1984 with the addition of the moon phase to the Day Date. Model 5594 remained in the catalogue for over 20 years, an absolute record for Audemars Piguet. Collectors nicknamed the Royal Oak Day Date 5572 “The Owl&quot;, in reference to the two large circular indicators placed on either side of the centre, indicating the day on the left and the date on the right. 1,770 units were sold between 1983 and 1998 and Model 5572 was renamed 25572 as early as 1984–85.  The materials are fairly evenly distributed, with approximately one third in steel, a bit less than one third in yellow gold and a little more than one third in the two-tone version (steel and yellow gold). By contrast, white gold variants account for less than 1% of total production.

The archives show a variant with a black dial, probably dating from the 1990s, since the bracelet bears the number 789, which replaced the 477 at that time.

Calibre 2124\u002F2825 also equipped a few other round watch models in the 1980s, notably Model 5588 (1984), 5589 (1985), 25614 and 25647 in 1986. From 1997, the calibre was replaced by its successor Calibre 2224\u002F2825, and then by Calibre 2324\u002F2825 from 2006.

by Audemars Piguet is one of the most iconic watching in the world. Take a tour of the Royal Oaks history starting with the Calibre 2020. ","12",{},"A FEAT OF MECHANICS","\u003Cp\u003EIt is at the heart of the Jura Mountains that the legendary Calibre 2120 was born in 1967, from the collaboration of three renowned companies LeCoultre &amp; Cie, Audemars Piguet and Vacheron Constantin.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA few years later, this mechanism was chosen by Audemars Piguet, a Manufacture then almost a 100 years old, to power the first high-end sports watch ...\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","background","THE FIRST SKETCH","\u003Cp\u003EOn April 11, 1970, at 4 pm, Georges Golay, then Audemars Piguet’s Managing Director, phoned Gérald Genta to ask him to draw “an unprecedented steel watch” for the next morning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe designer took inspiration from a childhood memory: the sight of divers, whose lives depended on the water-resistance of their helmets, ready to dive into the Rhône.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","group","PATENTED INNOVATION","\u003Cp\u003EWhat a crazy idea: an octagonal bezel punctuated by eight hexagonal screws going through the steel case and secured with eight nuts, all the while compressing a gigantic gasket!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe case makers were worried about the feasibility of such a watch. They asked if they could first practice on a gold version, a material more malleable than steel.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","ICONOCLAST?","\u003Cp\u003EThe Royal Oak was unveiled on April 15, 1972 at the Basel Fair. This unconventional, iconoclast and revolutionary timepiece shocked some, while appealed to others.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIt invented the notion of “sport chic” by blending two opposite worlds: Haute Horlogerie and sport. Robust yet hand made, oversize yet ultra-thin, this steel watch cost the price of gold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","FOR WOMEN","\u003Cp\u003ESmaller but even more radical! Designed by Jacquline Dimier, the very first Royal Oak variation was devoted to women.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EProportions were rethought, but the strength of its original codes permeated: straight lines, steel case, integrated bracelet, Tapisserie dial, hand finishes and, of course, a selfwinding movement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","mountain","FROM ENFANT TERRIBLE TO COLLECTION","\u003Cp\u003EIn 1977, the Royal Oak witnessed the addition of its first gold versions as well as an intermediate size. From then on, the enfant terrible of watchmaking broke free from its steel armour to become a remarkable ground of creative expression.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFifty years later, 550 variations have joined an all-star cast interpreting the original iconoclast that became an icon.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","PLAYS OF LIGHT","\u003Cp\u003EThe Royal Oak was designed to play with light. The thousands of pyramids adorning its dial, the facets of its bracelet, the chamfers of its bezel, the alternation of satin-finished and polished surfaces all contribute to making it shine.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first diamonds made their appearance in the collection in 1978, announcing a bright future for the Royal Oak.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","PERFECT FOR THE POCKET","\u003Cp\u003ERadical in 1972 and untouched for the first four years, the Royal Oak then became an extraordinary playground.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EUltra-thin and ultra-elegant, it left the wrist in 1979 to slide comfortably into the pocket of a suit.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","BETWEEN EARTH, MOON AND SKY","\u003Cp\u003EIn 1984, the Royal Oak welcomed the perpetual calendar movement, Calibre 2120\u002F2800 – the encounter of two legends.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the one hand, a ground-breaking mechanism which paved the way for the revival of complications in the aftermath of the quartz crisis. On the other, an avant-garde octagonal timepiece, whose future promised many surprises.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","DEFYING GRAVITY","\u003Cp\u003ETo celebrate the Royal Oak’s 25th anniversary, the Le Brassus watchmakers endowed the timepiece with a tourbillon – a complication then making a major comeback.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAt their workbenches, they created and assembled the 80
